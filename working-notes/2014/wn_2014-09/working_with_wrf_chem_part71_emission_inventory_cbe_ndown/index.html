<p>###WRF CHEM for Coimbatore domain with emission inventory and one way nesting using ndown.exe###</p>

<p>####WPS####
1. The WPS components geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe and metgrid.exe was from the output of last run on detailed in <a href="Working_with_WRF_CHEM_part7.0_CBE_DustOnlyTutorial.md">this</a></p>

<p>####real.exe####
1. Real.exe also from the last run <a href="Working_with_WRF_CHEM_part7.0_CBE_DustOnlyTutorial.md">output</a>. The output comprised of files namely wrfbdy<em>d01, wrfinput</em>d01, wrfinput<em>d02, wrfinput</em>d03, wrfinput<em>d04 were used as such for convert</em>emiss.exe run.</p>

<p>####Prep<em>Chem</em>Src.exe####
1. It was executed as per the <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/wrf_tutorial_nepal/exercise_2.html">tutorial</a> and Prep<em>Chem</em>Src.exe was executed by following point 3 in that tutorial.
2. The input file for Prep<em>Chem</em>Src.exe named as Prep<em>Chem</em>Src.inp is edited following namelist.wps last run based on <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/Emission_guide.pdf">emission<em>inventory</em>guide</a>, it has option for nesting also by choosing number of grids and for CBE case by entering four grids. The used inp file is <a href="prep_chem_sources.inp_CBE_4domain">this</a>. After editing inp file Prep<em>Chem</em>Src.exe was run by <code>./Prep_Chem_Src.exe</code> command in its bin folder. It run successfully as specified in the tutorial and it created seven files with three bin files for each grid as per the <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/wrf_tutorial_nepal/exercise_2.html">tutorial</a>. Earlier attempt failed by an un recognized error message and it was then resolved by editing a mistake in the inp file with two dots in variables such as <code>POLELAT</code>.
3. The created bin files are linked inside the em<em>real folder of wrf serial compile is made by the commands as per the [emission</em>inventory<em>guide](<a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/Emission">http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/Emission</a></em>guide.pdf). But the command creates broken link, the command has to changed as per below and executed from real_em folder</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As different from emiss<em>guide wrf</em>gocart<em>backg was given domain identifier for maintaining convention of executing convert</em>emiss.exe as wrf<em>gocart</em>backg_d01.</p>

<p>####convert<em>emiss.exe####
1. Nesting is not enabled with convert</em>emiss.exe as per <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/wrf_tutorial_2012_brazil/wrf-chem_tutorial_nesting.pdf">this</a>. So each nesting has to be run by changing the namelist.input and considering as single domain. So the namelist.input used in last DUSTONLY simulation was edited based on <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/Emission_guide.pdf">emission<em>inventory</em>guide</a> page number 8 and 9. The namelist was renamed as <code>namelist.input_CE_do1</code> for distinguishing domains. File name for wrf<em>gocart</em>backg_<em>d01 was renamed into wrf</em>gocart<em>backg and then executed convert</em>emiss.exe by <code>./convert_emiss.exe</code>
1. Convert_emiss.exe run for sometime end abruptly with following lines,</p>

<pre><code>            Number of fire emissions:         37
        FIRE EMISSIONS INPUT FILE TIME PERIOD (GMT):       -1 TO        0
        NOW OPEN FILE FOR WRITE: wrffirechemi_d01
        FIRE EMISSIONS OUTPUT file name: wrffirechemi_d01
        EMISSIONS CONVERSION : end of program
</code></pre>

<p>but it created three files as specified in the tutorial. It was rechecked with m2lab ncview and made sure that some emission inventory are there. Some doubts in fire emiss other than all are normal, firechemi all variables are blank it seems.</p>

<p>####real.exe####
1. After convert<em>emiss.exe again real.exe was executed with the same namelist.input and end with successful completion and creation of wrfinput and wrfbdy files.
####wrf.exe for D01####
1. With this the wrf.exe was run using this [namelist](namelist.input</em>CE_d01) and it ends with error saying that</p>

<pre><code>             FATAL CALLED FROM FILE:  &lt;stdin&gt;  LINE:     826
            ... Could not find matching time in input file wrfchemi_gocart_bg_d01
                -------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>this error problem was latter solved by correcting the namelist as per the earlier emission inventory tutorial namelist. the used namelsit was <a href="namelist.input_WRFrun01">this</a> and all former steps real.exe, convert_emiss.exe, and rea.exe was rerun for requiered input files for wrf.exe . Using that namelist solved the last error on wrf.exe but it ends with new error as below</p>

<pre><code>            Timing for processing lateral boundary for  domain        1:    0.14533 elapsed seconds
            WRF TILE   1 IS      1 IE     90 JS      1 JE     85
            WRF NUMBER OF TILES =   1
       1          40
            Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>The error segmentation fault seems to be a error due to large domain size as compared to last successful emission inventory tutorial. So the domain two of the current namelist is executed to check the last assumption.</li>

<li><p>Made soft link for prep<em>chem</em>src outputs for grid 2 that is for domain 2.</p>

<pre><code>        ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4_1/bin/FIRE-RRCH-T-2014-06-05-000000-g2-ab.bin emissopt3_d01

</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Edited namelist for moving the second domain as main first domain and run real.exe and it ends with error indicating mismatch with met<em>em domain size. So the domain 2 met</em>em file was soft linked and its name was changed as of domain one</p>

<pre><code>        ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/WRF_CHEM_trails/CBE_dustonly/WPS/met_em.d02.2014-06-05_03:00:00.nc .

</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Then run the real.exe with this <a href="namelist.inputWRFrun02">namelist</a> making chem<em>opt=0 and resolution into 9000 as of met</em>em file. it ran and created input and bdy file, with this convert<em>emiss.exe was run with this [namelist](namelist.input</em>CE_03), using real.exe namelist ends in creation of only wrfchemi no other chemi files. But used this <a href="namelist.inputWRFrun02">namelist</a>, it created all chemi files.</p></li>

<li><p>Reused the last used namelist and edited chem_opt=301 and run real.exe, it created bdy and input file, then wrf.exe it worked without memory error, making certain thaat problem is with large domain running wrf.exe.</p></li>

<li><p>Based on this <a href="http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=104">page</a>, it is expected that the error might be due to difference in namelist.input, so the current namelist.input was edited to consider this by comparing it with emissTut namelist. The edited namelist was <a href="namelist.inputWRFrun03">this</a>. But running wrf.exe return error of</p>

<pre><code>         FATAL CALLED FROM FILE:  &lt;stdin&gt;  LINE:     780
          input_wrf.F: SIZE MISMATCH:  namelist             ide,jde,kde=          90          85          31 ; input                        data ide,jde,kde=          90          85          36
             -------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>Indicating staring from real.exe has to run again.</p></li>

<li><p>Emiss files are linked by this command</p>

<pre><code>        ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4_1/bin/FIRE-RRCH-T-2014-06-05-000000-g1-ab.bin emissopt3_d01

</code></pre>

<p>Used this <a href="namelist.inputWRFrun03">namelist</a> for real.exe and this <a href="namelist.input_CE_04">namelist</a> for convert_emiss.exe. It created input and bdy condition files without any error.</p></li>

<li><p>With this <a href="namelist.inputWRFrun03">namelist</a> wrf.exe was run and it was running without any error, it took 3:15 hours to simulated do1 for 6 hours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>####Ndown for DO2####
1. Pre step for Ndown.exe is to have wrfinput file named as wrfndi<em>d02 for domain 02. So has to run the real.exe with all emiss input file and create wrfinput01 and wrfbdy01. For this the namelist was edited and used this [namelist](namelist.input</em>D02). The prep<em>chem</em>src link was made and run real.exe.</p>

<pre><code>            ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4_1/bin/FIRE-RRCH-T-2014-06-05-000000-g2-ab.bin emissopt3_d01
            ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4_1/bin/FIRE-RRCH-T-2014-06-05-000000-g2-bb.bin emissfire_d01
            ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4_1/bin/FIRE-RRCH-T-2014-06-05-000000-g2-gocartBG.bin wrf_gocart_backg
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Then executed real.exe with chem<em>opt=0 in the namelist.input for wrfinput</em>d01 and wrfbdy_d01, the metfiles for doiman d02 was changed into d01 for this. It created files as required.</li>
<li>These files are used for running convert<em>emiss.exe, by using this [namelist.input](namelist.input</em>CE<em>D02) file for specifically to create three chmei files created by the program. This resulted in creation of required files such as wrffirechemi</em>d01, wrfchemi<em>gocart</em>bg<em>d01 and wrfchemi</em>d01.</li>
<li>Then executed the real.exe using this <a href="namelist.input_D02">namelist.input</a> and it created two files of wrfinput<em>d01 and wrfbdy</em>d01 with files size 59.4MB and 54.6MB respectively. The files were renamed into wrfndi<em>d02 and wrfbdy</em>d01_D02 respectively.<br /></li>
<li>Using max<em>dom=2 [namelist](namelist.inputNdown</em>D01D02) for d01 and do2, then executed the ndown.exe. It created two files namely wrfinput<em>d02 and wrfbdy</em>d02 with files size of 15.7MB and 7.9MB respectively. The files makes to worry about the correctness of this procedure, since the input files are 50MB in range.</li>
<li>Then executed the wrf.exe using this <a href="namelist.input_D02">namelist.input</a>. it was successfully initiated. But forget to rename the wrf output of domain 01, the 00:00:00 file was replaced. It took 1 hour 20 minutes to run a single hour simulation. Considering this huge time requirement, the files are transfered to parallel compiled wrf and executed with 3 cores by tis command <code>mpirun -np 3 -host localhost ./wrf.exe
</code>, it considerably reduced the simulation time from 1 hour 20 minutes to 14 minutes for single hour simulation, this stands as astonishing achievement of parallel programming experienced by me.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>####Ndown for DO3####
1. Edited the last used <a href="namelist.input_D03">namelist</a> for single domain D02 for current domain D03. Changed chem<em>opt=301 into chem</em>opt=0 and renamed the metfiles into d01 domain from d03
and made link for non available time metfiles as follows</p>

<pre><code>            ln -sf /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/WRF_CHEM_trails/CBE_dustonly/WPS/met_em.d03.2014-06-05_03:00:00.nc .

<p>####Ndown for DO4####
1. Edited the last used <a href="namelist.input_D04">namelist</a> for single domain D03 for current domain D04. Changed chem<em>opt=301 into chem</em>opt=0 and renamed the metfiles into d01 domain from d03

<li><p>Then executed the wrf.exe using this <a href="namelist.input_D04">namelist.input</a> by changing chem<em>opt into 301 and changing into wrfinput</em>d01, wrfbdy<em>d01. Files such as wrfinput</em>d01, wrfbdy<em>d01, wrffirechemi</em>d01, wrfchemi<em>gocart</em>bg<em>d01, wrfchemi</em>d01 and namelist was copied inside parallel compiled wrf test/em_real folder</p></li>

<li><p>It took 8 to 9 hours for single hour simulation, so for 6 hour simulation it would take 36 hours. It created 234 MB files for each hour simulation output. The various steps taken for whole simulation is depcted in the <img src="/home/swl-sacon-dst/Documents/GISE_2013/LAB/Real_time_air_pollution_Mod_Proj-2013-2014/working_notes/wn_2014-09/WRF_CHEM_cbe_nestingA1.png" alt="fiugre" title="steps in WRF CHEM CBE emission inventory" /></p></li>
