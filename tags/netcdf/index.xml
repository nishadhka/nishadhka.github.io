      <description>###Plot NETCDF and create xlsx file for pyWRFChemEmiss####
 The 2010 anthropogenic emission file of Asian region is available in netcdf format. To use it with WRF CHEM, PREPCHEMSRC is limited use mainy because the emission source has to specify and it&amp;rsquo;s conversion factor might not be correct. Complexity/understandability is case for similar emission converter program such as Air Emissions Processor program and SMOKE. In this regard pyWRFChemEmiss give more modular and easy interface to convert emission file to be used with wrf chem.</description>

      <description>To query a NetCDF with latitude and longitude is required for objective three, in which user pointed lat-long, revived as SMS from Android app has to parsed and find its model and nearest Dylos monitoring station to send replay. There is handy tutorial on this with elaboration on different implementations advantages In which most advanced querying based on KDtree, this implementation was used to query NetCDF generated from WRF model the code is as follows</description>

      <description>To install NetCDF-python requires HDF, based on this The HDF installation from source got failed, used the synaptic package manager instead to install HDF5 Downloaded NetCDF-python, extracted and run python setup.py install Failed, saying NetCDF is not found in usr/ So followed this, downloaded version of NetCDF-4.0.1, placed in /usr/local Doing cd into netcdf-4.0.1, and run the code
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include ./configure --enable-netcdf-4 --enable-dap --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local  Then doing sudo make and then sudo make install, seems got installed, then went into netcdf4-python as given in this</description>

      <description>Tried with grib2json for converting NetCDF into JSON 1 For this NetCDF has to converted into grib2 For converting into grib2, python based iris is useful 2, but only work with cf compliant NetCDF WRF output in NetCDF is not a cf compliant So has to use a tool which converts WRF NetCDF into CF compliant The Wrfncxnj.py tool 3 exactly do this with more functions such as extraction of variables.</description>
