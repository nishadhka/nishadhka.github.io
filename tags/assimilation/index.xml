      <description>###compile GSI in Ubunut 14.04###
 GSI was tried to compile in Ubuntu 12.04, but ended with failure. GSI requires Gfortran 4.7 and above, but 12.04 repository for up to 4.6, so ubuntu has to upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 to have gfortran 4.7. Due to this Server was upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and compiled WRFV4.3.1 and WPS 4.3.1 in it. It was by Gfortran 4.8.2, Netcdf 4.1.3, and other necessary libraries such as libpng, zlib and jasper as per apt-get method.</description>
