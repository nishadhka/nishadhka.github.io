#to Do 1. write the script, lazywrfchem 1. draw computational inventory of the cluster comparision experiment, and libnrary program needed 1. compile the library 1. do the experiment
#single computer HP laptop, parallell execution, three cores
Domain four: onehour=12:16 to 08:43, 8.5 hours so for 6 hours simulation= 48+24=72 hours Domain Three: one hour=01:24 to 02:24, 1 hour so for 6 hours simulation= 6 hours Domain two: onehour=9:10 to 9:23, 13 minutes so for 6 hours simulation=13minx6=1.</description>

      <description>####cubie truck cluster for WRF CHEM####
This note explains the steps in creating Cubietruck cluster for WRF CHEM modeling.
#####Installing debian##### 1. Cubietruck is having Android OS preinstalled as its main os for its inbuilt nand storage of 8 GB hard disk. To change this into Debian os following steps were followed. 1. Made several attempts for running Debian or ubuntu os image in Cubietruck. Later found a tweaked image from here at first sight shows promising for WRF CHEM.</description>

 Related to the last note on getting txt time series data from wrf output here. This note details getting numpy array from wrf output and plotting data in python. The variables required from wrfoutput are Temperature, Relative humidity, Wind direction, wind speed, PM2.5 and PM 10. Numpy array from these variables will be used for air earth application, to insert the grid data into Postgresql. Data plots is for a quick view of the wrf output.</description>

      <description>###Use script to execute WRF CHEM CBE### 1. To run in real time and in cluster environment(AWS or ARM), various steps of WRF have to be made into script. 1. There are several python based scripts avaiable for running WRF. The script lazyWRF is a neat and simple script to run wrf from WPS stage. 1. The script has minor problem in running, it was forked from its git hub repository and edited.</description>

      <description>###Working on REAS emission inventory to feed into WRF-CHEM### 1. REAS is an emission inventory for Asia, it has separate files for different pollutant with each category of emission source. For example, pollutant SO2 has 9 data files for each emission source types such as Aviation, Domestic, Industry etc for the year 2008.
1. The files are space separated text files having fields (columns) for longitude, latitude and monthly emission value 1.</description>

 Compiled netcdf4.2.1.1 based on the [compile.wrf] but it didn&amp;rsquo;t generating nay netcdf.inc as needed by the wrf fortran code and so fails in netcdf gfortran testing stage. Another option is to use netcdf3.6.3, and it gets compiled and generated netcdf.inc, the codes used for compilations are, export CC=gcc export CXX=g++ export FC=gfortran export FCFLAGS=-m64 export F77=gfortran export FFLAGS=-m64

 WRF CHEM domain in nested has to be visualized to correct the nesting and for domain size adjustment. There are few tools available to do that such as dwiz of wrf ems and plotgrid.ncl. There is an alternative with python based on this, it is a wrf script tools for visualizing and nesting based simulation.

WRF-CHEM is a computationally intensive model, for example, &amp;ldquo;On a typically-sized 40×40 grid with 20 horizontal layers, the meteorological part of the simulation (the WRF weather model itself) is only 160 × 106 floating point operations per time step, about 2.5% the cost of the full WRF-Chem with both chemical kinetics and aerosol&amp;rdquo;[1]. It is generally executed with parallel mode to reduce time latency of model execution time.</description>

      <description>In a measure to make the compiled executables reuse, made a copy of WPS folder and WRFv3, parallel compiled folder test/real_em* into a new folder of cbe_domain. The link gets broken, and no correct files were copied by doing mere copy paste. Instead, a try was made as per the m2lab tutorial and copied the files from em_real as like this cp /em_real/* ., this time the link was not made, but the executables get copied, it has to check whether it is working For starting WPS of WRF with geogrid, used the namelist.</description>

      <description>Trail for WRF-CHEM, working with WRF simulation with Katrina single domain case
 It is based on this to run compiled WRF in serial mode to execute the Katrina case with a single domain. As per this page, the WPS ungrib stage was carried out  WPS: Ungrib
 The tar file provided with the tutorial was unzipped and compiled WPS folder was copied and bothe these folders were kept under a folder named katrina.</description>

      <description>##Trail for WRF-CHEM, WRF simulation with Katrina case and one-way Nesting-Ndown.exe## 1. Based on this to run compiled wrf in serial mode to execute the Katrina case with the nested model run by Ndown.exe based one-way nesting.
###WPS: Ungrib###
 As per this page, the WPS ungrib stage was carried out. Unzipped the tar file provided with the tutorial. Copied WPS folder both under a shared folder named as katrina_nesting. The vtable was linked inside the WPS folder by ln -sf ungrib/Variable_Tables/Vtable.</description>

      <description>Coimbatore domain made with four nests has been run with WRF-EMS with resolution starting from 100&amp;gt;27&amp;gt;9&amp;gt;3&amp;gt;1km. The domain is made using dwiz application in WRF-EMS. However, to test the domain above the Coimbatore region, the output was subject for wrfncxnj.py utility. It took 4 hours and 33 minutes to run this domain in IBM X4 series server computer with 16 GB ram. To overlay the Coimbatore city shape file above the WRF output NetCDF from wrfcnxnj.</description>

      <description>Running prep-chem-src
 Based on part 1 prep-chem-SRC was compiled and ready to execute for emission inventory creation. Following WRF-chem Nepal tutorial and PREP-CHEM-SRC, README edited prep_chem_sources.inp. Then run the program by executing ./prep_chem_sources_RADM_WRF_FIM.exe, it ran for some steps but exited with error of Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error*** saying the HDF5 version used in compiling is 1.8.8 and version for running PREP-CHEM-SRC is 1.8.12 To check what hdf5 is used by prepchesrc, run a command h5dump -V which gives h5dump: Version 1.</description>

      <description>To convert wrf output into a text file for the value of a specified lat long Using the script WrfncXnj.py, convert wrf output in cf abiding nc file The steps are as follows, cp wrfout_d04* /home/hoopoe/wrfncxnj-0.1_r2120/. To get the list of available files in a directory
import os a=[] for file in os.listdir(&amp;quot;/home/hoopoe/wrfncxnj-0.1_r2120/&amp;quot;): if file.startswith(&amp;quot;wrfout_d04&amp;quot;): a.append(file)  To run a external python script from another python script,
import subprocess a= wrfout_d04_2014-06-11_00:00:00 subprocess.</description>

      <description>compiling and install prep-chem-src
 To install prep-chem-src, it requires to install HDF5,ZLIB and NETCDF based on the readme of PREPCHEMSRC as follows
Third Party Software Requirements --------------------------------- 1. ZLIB 1.2.5(libz.a) or later distribution. You may download the software from the http://www.zlib.net/ site. 2. HDF5-1.8.8(libhdf5_fortran.a, libhdf5hl_fortran.a) or later distribution. You may download the software from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html. 3. NetCDF 4.1.1 (libnetcdf.a). You may download the software from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-4_0_1/index.jsp Configuring/Installing HDF 5 ------------------------------ When compiling PREP-CHEM-SRC codes on a Linux system using the PGI (Intel) compiler, make sure the netCDF and HDF* library has been installed using the same PGI (Intel) compiler.</description>

The steps for running WPS as per the m2lab tutorial
Geogrid
 Create namelist and geogrid Copy wps folder and edit namelist for domain Use ncl program to view the domain Reflat and reflon center point of the domain, ewe, esn, number of point in x and y-direction Edit geog file location in name list and geogrid output location Then run geogrid.exe, run geogrid after editing the name list as .</description>

      <description>For running wrf.exe after wps, wrf.exe and real.exe is not being made during the compilation of wrf-chem. Made a new compilation of wrf alone to make it work. The compilation involves only setting environment, installing dependent packages and running, ./configure then ./compile em_real and ./compile emi_conv The first step of .configure ended with an error saying cannot find NetCDF in the path, the path specified is the wrong one. The file sudo nano bash.</description>
