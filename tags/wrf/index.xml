      <description>Coimbatore domain made with four nests has been run with WRF-EMS with resolution starting from 100&amp;gt;27&amp;gt;9&amp;gt;3&amp;gt;1km. The domain is made using dwiz application in WRF-EMS. However, to test the domain above the Coimbatore region, the output was subject for wrfncxnj.py utility. It took 4 hours and 33 minutes to run this domain in IBM X4 series server computer with 16 GB ram. To overlay the Coimbatore city shape file above the WRF output NetCDF from wrfcnxnj.</description>

      <description>Running prep-chem-src
 Based on part 1 prep-chem-SRC was compiled and ready to execute for emission inventory creation. Following WRF-chem Nepal tutorial and PREP-CHEM-SRC, README edited prep_chem_sources.inp. Then run the program by executing ./prep_chem_sources_RADM_WRF_FIM.exe, it ran for some steps but exited with error of Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error*** saying the HDF5 version used in compiling is 1.8.8 and version for running PREP-CHEM-SRC is 1.8.12 To check what hdf5 is used by prepchesrc, run a command h5dump -V which gives h5dump: Version 1.</description>

      <description>To convert wrf output into a text file for the value of a specified lat long Using the script WrfncXnj.py, convert wrf output in cf abiding nc file The steps are as follows, cp wrfout_d04* /home/hoopoe/wrfncxnj-0.1_r2120/. To get the list of available files in a directory
import os a=[] for file in os.listdir(&amp;quot;/home/hoopoe/wrfncxnj-0.1_r2120/&amp;quot;): if file.startswith(&amp;quot;wrfout_d04&amp;quot;): a.append(file)  To run a external python script from another python script,
import subprocess a= wrfout_d04_2014-06-11_00:00:00 subprocess.</description>

      <description>compiling and install prep-chem-src
 To install prep-chem-src, it requires to install HDF5,ZLIB and NETCDF based on the readme of PREPCHEMSRC as follows
Third Party Software Requirements --------------------------------- 1. ZLIB 1.2.5(libz.a) or later distribution. You may download the software from the http://www.zlib.net/ site. 2. HDF5-1.8.8(libhdf5_fortran.a, libhdf5hl_fortran.a) or later distribution. You may download the software from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html. 3. NetCDF 4.1.1 (libnetcdf.a). You may download the software from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-4_0_1/index.jsp Configuring/Installing HDF 5 ------------------------------ When compiling PREP-CHEM-SRC codes on a Linux system using the PGI (Intel) compiler, make sure the netCDF and HDF* library has been installed using the same PGI (Intel) compiler.</description>

      <description>working with WRF-CHEM: Running WPS
The steps for running WPS as per the m2lab tutorial
Geogrid
 Create namelist and geogrid Copy wps folder and edit namelist for domain Use ncl program to view the domain Reflat and reflon center point of the domain, ewe, esn, number of point in x and y-direction Edit geog file location in name list and geogrid output location Then run geogrid.exe, run geogrid after editing the name list as .</description>

      <description>For running wrf.exe after wps, wrf.exe and real.exe is not being made during the compilation of wrf-chem. Made a new compilation of wrf alone to make it work. The compilation involves only setting environment, installing dependent packages and running, ./configure then ./compile em_real and ./compile emi_conv The first step of .configure ended with an error saying cannot find NetCDF in the path, the path specified is the wrong one. The file sudo nano bash.</description>

      <description>To get a sum of seconds WRF is running, the wrf.out.log was imported into python to sum the elapsed seconds in each domain To get the log file into wrf bf = open(&#39;run_wrfm.log&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) To read each lines in the file bf_lines=bf.readlines() To make the lines into list array and select only the list with particular words in it, here the word &amp;ldquo;Timing for Writing&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Tried with grib2json for converting NetCDF into JSON 1 For this NetCDF has to converted into grib2 For converting into grib2, python based iris is useful 2, but only work with cf compliant NetCDF WRF output in NetCDF is not a cf compliant So has to use a tool which converts WRF NetCDF into CF compliant The Wrfncxnj.py tool 3 exactly do this with more functions such as extraction of variables.</description>

      <description>EMS-WRF for Coimbatore region using four domains
Five simple steps required for the execution of EMS (Environmental modeling system) WRF.
After the successful installation of EMS follow these steps,
Step 1: Create a computational domain with the Domain Wizard(DW) GUI
 Start the DW by executing the command &amp;ldquo;dwiz&amp;rdquo; in the terminal. DW window should appear and gives an option to select from creating a new domain or modifying an existing Domain.</description>

      <description>To visualize WRF output in GIS platform so that it would have an extra hand in interactive visualization and spatial analysis out of it. Python script (modified from http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2013-November/037602.html and http://geoexamples.blogspot.in/2013/09/reading-wrf-netcdf-files-with-gdal.html) used to convert NetCDF into GeoTIFF format. However, the given scripts in those links are throwing an error while converting eWRF NetCDF output, saying there are multiple bands in specific variables say for example U10. Slightly changed those code to collect one band out of 24 bands in U10 (In some variables the band number goes around 650, like P) and converted into GeoTIFF without error and can visualize it in QGIS.</description>
