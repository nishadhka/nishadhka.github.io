The BOOT foilder content was not as such of this note,these files were making problem related with rebooting of the parallella. For this there is a foruym post states that need of device tree.dtb has to be changed and there is a file was attached with that. Using that file the problem of no rebooting of parallella was solved 1.</description>

      <description>###Ubunut 12.04 recovery###
 It is found that changing the file /etc/environment has huge problem after reboot. Added the environment variables for ncl language in /etc/environment as export NCARG_ROOT=/usr/local/ncl-6.2.1; export PATH=$NCARG_ROOT/bin:$PATH. This was resultant in problematic reboot of the system. The system gets instead of into login page, gets flickering command log. By reboot went inside of command line and there no system command like ls or sudo was not working.</description>

 Using git and github, to remove a file which is committed earlier is requier following steps. Even though the file will be removed with delete button option of OS. The committed files still be inside the git version control system and it will make problem in uploading it into github if it is large file size &amp;gt;100MB accidently committed. First to list the files deleted in the OS but not in git system, based on this.</description>

 After running with problem of excessive particle reading in UPS back up power, this note discuss its redeployment in same station. The problem of UPS back up power excessive reading was contained by using pure sine wave UPS. In redeployment as an addition, DHT11, humidity temperature sensor was added along with DYLOS, RPi, USB data card setup. The DHT 11 humidity temperature sensor was attached with RPI following this as per the below .</description>

 The 2010 anthropogenic emission file of Asian region is available in netcdf format. To use it with WRF CHEM, PREPCHEMSRC is limited use mainy because the emission source has to specify and it&amp;rsquo;s conversion factor might not be correct. Complexity/understandability is case for similar emission converter program such as Air Emissions Processor program and SMOKE. In this regard pyWRFChemEmiss give more modular and easy interface to convert emission file to be used with wrf chem.</description>

For example runnnnig of the python command for getting dylos serial read ends as follows

 Related to the last note on getting txt time series data from wrf output here. This note details getting numpy array from wrf output and plotting data in python. The variables requiered from wrfoutput are Temperature, Realtive humidity, Wind direction, wind speed, PM2.5 and PM 10. Numpy array from these variables will be used for air earth application, to insert the grid data into Postgresql. Data plots is for quick view of the wrf output.</description>

      <description>###compile GSI in Ubunut 14.04###
 GSI was tried to compile in Ubuntu 12.04, but ended with failure. GSI requieres Gfortran 4.7 and above, ubunut 12.04 repostory is updated upto 4.6, so ubunut has to upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 to have gfortran 4.7. Due to this Server was upghraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and compiled WRFV4.3.1 and WPS 4.3.1 in it. It was by Gfortran 4.8.2, Netcdf 4.1.3, and other necssary libraries such as libpng, zlib and jasper as per apt-get method.</description>

      <description>###Working on REAS emission inventory to feed into WRF-CHEM### 1. REAS is a emission inventory for Asia, it has files for different pollutant separated with each category of emission source. For example, pollutant SO2 has 9 files for each emission source categories such as Aviation, Domestic, Industry etc for year 2008.
1. The files are space separated txt files having fields (columns) for longitude, latitude and monthly emission value 1. Python library pandas is used for importing data into python environment and combining these different category emission source files (9 files) into one single file.</description>

      <description>###Parallella cluster for WRF CHEM### 1. WRF-CHEM is a computationally intensive model, for example &amp;ldquo;On a typically-sized 40×40 grid with 20 horizontal layers, the meteorological part of the simulation (the WRF weather model itself) is only 160 × 106 floating point operations per time step, about 2.5% the cost of the full WRF-Chem with both chemical kinetics and aerosol&amp;rdquo;[1].It is generally executed with parallel mode to reduce time latency of model execution time.</description>

The link gets broken, and no correct files were copied by doing mere copy paste. Instead, a try was made as per the m2lab tutorial and copied the files from em_real as like this cp /em_real/* ., this time the link was not made, but the executables get copied, it has to check whether it is working For starting WPS of WRF with geogrid, used the namelist.</description>

The main problem faced is with BibTeX based referencing, and could not be solved and used normal superscript referencing. Another problem faced was box and its colour choosing, it was solved following this excellent tutorial  </description>

 Installation of netcdf is through compiling and package installation from synaptic package manager. Synaptic and latest source download compilation gives error of &amp;ldquo;no netcdf.inc&amp;rdquo; in hysplit compile. It is due to a fortran binding lapse in latest verision.

The workaround was by pressing ENTER after few minutes of server reboot, solved!. This problem was with Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS in IBM, started after sudo apt-get upgrade . One of the option to resolve grub struck problem is to edit the grub2 options in file /etc/default/grub, but in the server there is no such file.</description>
