    "An ecosystem is a complex entity with several interacting\n",
    "components. Ecologists face problems of devising appropriate\n",
    "research design to understand complexity of ecosystem. It requires\n",
    "a realistic model to test the ecological theories. A large landscape\n",
    "is too big and too complex to conduct a good scientific research.\n",
    "Therefore, research experiments that miniature large ecosystems\n",
    "are often recommended to make a realistic prediction of ecosystem\n",
    "process. Natural small scale habitats such as tree hole aquatic\n",
    "habitats provide basic features of a large aquatic ecosystem and\n",
    "offer several methodological advantages over lakes, streams, and\n",
    "other comparatively large systems (e.g. Maguire 1971). First, tree\n",
    "holes can be treated as individual units for sampling. Second, they\n",
    "are rich in species diversity and abundance, mainly those of insects\n",
    "(e.g. Kitching 2000). Third, water-filled tree holes are the most\n",
    "tractable small aquatic systems, partly because they are relatively\n",
    "persistent, and can be mimicked with plastic cups, bamboo\n",
    "sections, or other inexpensive materials. Furthermore, tree holes\n",
    "have a defined boundary and size. In such habitats, both biotic\n",
    "condition (e.g., predation) and abiotic condition (physio-chemical\n",
    "characteristics) vary greatly, which makes them easily colonized\n",
    "by specialized communities starting from autotrophic fungi to\n",
    "predaceous amphibians (Yanoviak 1999).\n",
    "Tree holes have short period for community colonization/\n",
    "generation and therefore they can be manipulated the energy\n",
    "source. They have a definitive ecosystem boundary. Laboratory\n",
    "microcosm has the limited overgeneralization potential of the\n",
    "ecosystem (Carpenter et al. 1998, Srivastava et al. 2004) (Figure\n",
    "1). Tree hole habitats are similar to artificial one such as plastic\n",
    "containers that can maintain natural conditions by accumulating\n",
    "rain water and fallen leaf litter. The heterotrophic community in\n",
    "such habitats is easily manageable and mimics natural realism —\n",
    "the two main characteristics required for experimenting model\n",
    "ecosystems.\n",
    "The tree hole aquatic ecosystem can be a model to test two\n",
    "principle ecological mechanisms: complementarity and selection\n",
    "(Loreau and Hector 2001). The ‘complementarity mechanism’\n",

    "explains that species rich systems use more resources\n",
    "and are more productive. It is because each species uses\n",
    "slightly different resources and overall species richness\n",
    "contributes for ecosystem productivity. ‘Selection\n",
    "mechanism’ explains that there is a variation between\n",
    "individual species in its ability to utilize resource,\n",
    "and certain species is more productive than others.\n",
    "Thus, productivity is the average contribution of each\n",
    "species. It is assumed that both these mechanisms are\n",
    "interplaying to improve ecosystem function (Loreau\n",
    "2000). Bell et al. (2005) found that bacterial diversity\n",
    "was crucial for ecological functioning in tree hole\n",
    "aquatic habitats. Here bacterial diversity was negatively\n",
    "associated with ‘respiration - an ecosystem service’. This\n",
    "study showed that influence of bacterial species richness\n",
    "and composition was more important than selection\n",
    "mechanism for ecosystem functioning in the bacterial\n",
    "community.\n",
    "Pimm et al. (1991) showed that structure of a food\n",
    "web depends on availability of energy and dynamic\n",
    "constrains. Local dynamic constraint refers to variability\n",
    "of food web characteristics (e.g. length of food chain) in\n",
    "various ecosystems due to differences in environmental\n",
    "factors. Accordingly, the shorter the food chains the\n",
    "more stable an ecosystem would be (Pimm and Lawton\n",
    "1977). Such hypotheses can be tested by performing\n",
    "experiments in the tree hole aquatic habitats. Jenkins\n",
    "et al. (1992) demonstrated influence of dynamic\n",
    "constraints on food web by using artificial analogues\n",
    "of tree hole aquatic habitat. In this study, they lowered\n",
    "temporal food web dynamics during low rainfall in an\n",
    "experimental container, and found that lowering had the\n",
    "most pronounced effect on the most productive habitats.\n",
    "This experiment gave an evidence for the support of\n",
    "dynamic constraint. Diverse communities are expected\n",
    "to have less temporal variability in biomass than species-\n",
    "poor counterparts (Odum 1971). However, experiment\n",
    "on the tree hole habitat is not sufficient to test “more\n",
    "individual hypothesis” (i.e., more productivity results\n",
    "in higher abundance, and species richness is a function\n",
    "of abundance - Srivastava and Lawton 1998) because\n",
    "theory governing species-productivity relationship\n",
    "is complex and it fails to consider the colonization,\n",
    "extinction pattern and size variability of inhabitants in\n",
    "the tree hole habitat.\n",
    "Tree hole aquatic habitat is an ideal place to assess\n",
    "impacts of anthropogenic pressures on ecosystem (Taub\n",
    "et al. 1997). Several authors (e.g., Paradise and Dunson\n",
    "1997, Paradise and Kuhn 1999), for example, tested\n",
    "effect of acidic deposition on tree hole communities and\n",
    "found that the biota of tree hole habitat is differentially\n",
    "affected by acidic deposition. The low pH was found to\n",
    "have a determinant role on the growth of certain key\n",
    "inhabitants and on community interactions by affecting\n",
    "the process of chain commensalisms that occur in\n",
    "tree hole aquatic habitat. Therefore, tree hole habitats\n",
    "have been used as a bio-indicator of forest ecosystem\n",
    "to test acidic deposition. Furthermore, temporary\n",
    "waters such as tree hole aquatic habitats, in general,\n",
    "are ideal ecosystem unit to study species adapted in\n",
    "the highly variable environments. A subtle change in\n",
    "the water quality such as pH may affect largely on the\n",
    "species emergence structure, especially the Odonate\n",
    "larvae, a known predator, which could influence the\n",
    "entire population. It is therefore concluded that tree\n",
    "hole aquatic habitats can be used for several ecological\n",
    "experiments that mimic large natural ecosystems.\n",
