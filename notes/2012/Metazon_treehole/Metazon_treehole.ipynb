    "**Abstract:** In a study of the metazoan community composition in tree hole aquatic habitat of a tropical rainforest, Silent Valley National Park, and the adjacent moist deciduous forest, New Amarambalam Reserve Forest, of the Western Ghats, 28 different species were recorded from 150 tree hole aquatic habitats with an average of 3–5 species per tree hole. Most of the recorded organisms (96.8%) belong to Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), Heteroptera (bugs), Diptera (flies), Coleoptera (beetles) and Trichoptera (caddisflies). The study reports the first record of toe-winged beetle larvae (Ptilodactylidae) in a tree hole aquatic habitat. The most significant observation is the prolific occurrence of  trichopteran larvae as the second most abundant taxa in tree holes of Silent Valley National Park, and this stands as the first comprehensive record of the entire order in the habitat studied. The study upholds the importance of less explored\n",
    "microhabitats in the Western Ghats region in terms of sustaining unique community composition in the most delicate and  extreme habitat conditions. It also puts forward important ecological research questions on biodiversity ecosystem functionality which could impart important lessons for managing and conserving the diminishing tropical evergreen forests which are significant for these unique habitats. \n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Phytotelmata, plant held aquatic habitats in tree\n",
    "holes are one of the important classes of aquatic\n",
    "ecosystems (Kitching 2000). These habitats are\n",
    "formed by the stagnation of rain water in cavities or\n",
    "depression of trees which make them one of the widely\n",
    "distributed and most abundant fresh water ‘hanging\n",
    "aquaria’ in forested woodlands (Kitching 1971). Well defined boundaries, confined size and extreme physio-\n",
    "chemical conditions make these habitats colonized\n",
    "by specialized communities starting from autotrophic\n",
    "fungi to predaceous amphibians (Yanoviak 1999). It\n",
    "has attracted immense fascination from naturalists\n",
    "and community ecologists due to its canopy aquatic\n",
    "community, wide spatial and replicable distribution\n",
    "and extension of experimental studies on it (Kitching\n",
    "2001). The physical barriers of a tree hole aquatic\n",
    "habitat sustains discrete communities in it that are\n",
    "mostly subsets of the larger forest ecosystems. Together\n",
    "with those features and methodological advantage\n",
    "for experimental studies makes them important\n",
    "experimental tools in ecology for studying processes\n",
    "and patterns occurring at the level of the community\n",
    "(Srivastava et al. 2004). Epidemiological importance\n",
    "of these habitats as major breeding grounds for disease\n",
    "spreading organisms such as mosquitos has further\n",
    "attracted the attention of these habitats to medical\n",
    "entomologists (Jenkins & Carpenter 1946; Maguire\n",
    "1971).\n",
    "Extensive studies were carried out on these habitats\n",
    "in various parts of the world. But, the knowledge on\n",
    "the Indian tree hole aquatic habitat and its community\n",
    "composition is meager. In India, apart from the species\n",
    "listing and the natural history observations, only a\n",
    "few research efforts have addressed the ecological\n",
    "functionality and the responses of aquatic insects to\n",
    "specific ecosystems (Subramanian & Sivaramakrishnan\n",
    "2005). All other studies were of epidemiological\n",
    "concern (Rao et al. 1970; Nagpal & Sharma 1985). The\n",
    "present study, the first of its kind in India, was carried\n",
    "out to assess the community composition in tree hole aquatic habitats.\n",
    "## Materials and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "The study was carried out in the Silent Valley\n",
    "National Park (SVNP) and New Amaramblam Reserve\n",
    "Forest (NARF) of the Western Ghats, Kerala from\n",
    "December 2009 to September 2010. This region is\n",
    "classified as west coast tropical wet evergreen forest,\n",
    "(Champion & Seth 1968; 11 0 03’–11 0 13’N & 76 0 21’–\n",
    "76 0 35’E) and forms a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere\n",
    "Reserve (Image 1). The forests of SVNP fall under the\n",
    "category of Malabar rainforest realm and the vegetation\n",
    "comprises mainly of the westcoast tropical evergreen\n",
    "and semievergreen forests (Udvardy 1975; Champion\n",
    "& Seth 1968). The annual mean temperature in the\n",
    "SVNP ranges between 18 0 C and 23 0 C and mean annual\n",
    "precipitation ranges from 3200–5000 mm between the\n",
    "sections (Table 1). NARF (11 0 26’–11 0 9’N & 75 0 45’–\n",
    "76 0 33’E) is a west coast tropical moist deciduous\n",
    "forest bordering northwest of SVNP. The annual mean\n",
    "temperature in this forest ranges from 21–38 0 C and\n",
    "mean annual precipitation is 2397mm (Das 2008).\n",

    "## Survey Methods:\n",
    "In SVNP tree holes were sampled from three regions\n",
    "of the park, namely, Sairandhri (n=68), Poochipara\n",
    "(n=34) and Walakkad (n=35) whereas in NARF tree\n",
    "holes were mostly sampled from Panapuzha (n=13).\n",
    "For every tree hole sampled, structural characteristics of\n",
    "the tree hole such as diameter were measured by taking\n",
    "two longest hole opening measurements perpendicular\n",
    "to each other (Sota 1998).\n",
    "The variables such as depth, water volume and\n",
    "height of the tree hole from the ground, girth at breast\n",
    "height (GBH) of the tree were also measured. Water\n",
    "from the tree hole was extracted by siphoning and the\n",
    "volume measured using a measuring cylinder. The\n",
    "content of the tree hole such as leaf litter and detritus\n",
    "were transferred to a tray and thoroughly checked\n",
    "for the presence of life forms (Image 2). Thorough\n",
    "checks were made with the aid of a flashlight for\n",
    "elusive organisms in cervices present in the tree hole.\n",
    "The water contents were then sieved with successive\n",
    "sieves from coarse to finer sieves (cc-500μm sieve\n",
    "size) by holding in a plastic tray. The organisms were\n",
    "counted and morpho-species preserved in 5% formalin\n",
    "(Yanoviak & Fincke 2005). The collected specimens\n",
    "were sorted out and identified to possible taxonomic\n",
    "level of family/genus following Edmondson (1959),\n",
    "and Subramanian & Sivaramkrishnan (2007).\n",

    "## Results and Discussion:\n",
    "The vegetation patterns in SVNP (Manilal 1988;\n",
    "Vajravelu 1990; Das 2008) and NARF (Sharma et\n",
    "al. 2002) are well documented. Most of the tree\n",
    "holes sampled in SVNP were from the tree species,\n",
    "Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, Syzygium cumini, Mesua\n",
    "ferrea, Holigarna arnottiana, Artocarpus heterophyllus,\n",
    "Dysoxylum malabaricum, Hopea parviflora, Myristica\n",
    "dactyloides and Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, whereas in\n",
    "NARF, the tree holes sampled belonged to Mangifera\n",
    "indica, Stereospermum chelnoids, Homonoia riparia,\n",
    "Tetramales nudiflora and Albizia lebbeck. A majority\n",
    "of the tree holes were of the ‘pan’ type (80.4%) which\n",
    "appeared as a depression in the trunk. The remaining\n",
    "tree holes were ‘rot’ type (19.6%) wherein the tree holes\n",
    "were formed by wreckage in the tree. Altogether, 7505\n",
    "individuals of metazoans were recorded from 150 tree\n",
    "hole aquatic habitats. Aquatic insects belonging to the\n",
    "orders Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), Trichoptera\n",
    "(caddisflies), Heteroptera (bugs), and Odonata\n",
    "(dragonflies and damselflies) together comprised\n",
    "96.8% of the entire collection (Table 2; Image 3). The\n",
    "remaining 3.2% were the representatives of the taxa\n",
    "from Dermaptera, Annelida, Collembola, Gastropoda,\n",
    "Diplopoda, Geckonidae (Reptilia) and Anura\n",
    "(Amphibia). Larvae of marsh beetles (Scritidae) were\n",
    "the most abundant taxa, which occurred in 83.3% of\n",
    "all the tree holes sampled with an average abundance\n",
    "of 28.5±56.6 individuals per tree hole at Sairandhri,\n",
    "27.9±42.6 at Poochipara, 20.08±20 at Walakkad and\n",
    "10.84±13.13 at Panapuzha. It was followed by larvae\n",
    "of Trichoptera (62.6%) with the highest abundance\n",
    "of 17.3±42.6 individuals at Sairandhri, 7.9±15.3\n",
    "individuals at Poochipara, 2.1±3.7 individuals in\n",
    "Walakkad. Trichoptera was completely absent in\n",
    "the tree holes sampled at Panapuzha. With regard to\n",
    "richness of taxa, a typical tree hole in SVNP harbors\n",
    "4±1.7 taxa with a range of one to 11 different taxa\n",
    "per tree hole whereas Panapuzha of NARF harbored\n",
    "3.6±1.3 taxa with a range of 1–6 different taxa per tree\n",
    "hole. Out of 16 aquatic insect taxa recorded, nine were\n",
    "Diptera, four Coleoptera and one each of Trichoptera,\n",
    "Heteroptera, and Odonata. About 13 taxa of aquatic\n",
    "insects present in the tree holes were in the larval stage\n",
    "while three taxa belonging to Hydrophilidae, Dytiscidae\n",
    "of Coleoptera and Heteroptera were in the adult stage.\n",

    "The structural characteristics, community structure,\n",
    "number of taxa and their abundance as well as the\n",
    "number of predators and saprophages present in the\n",
    "tree holes are given in Table 3. The saprophages\n",
    "include Scirtidae and Tipulidae. Scirtidae which are\n",
    "commonly called marsh beetles is the most abundant\n",
    "and highly characteristic group of tree hole aquatic\n",
    "habitat in the study area. It uses its specialized\n",
    "mouth parts to shred the leaf litters and in turn largely\n",
    "facilitate the conversion of coarse particulate organic\n",
    "matter (CPOM) into fine particulate organic matter\n",
    "(FPOM). This species is considered to be an important\n",
    "community structure determining factor in tree hole\n",
    "aquatic habitats (Paradise & Dunson 1997). There\n",
    "were about four prominent genera namely Cyphon,\n",
    "Princocyphon, Elodes, and Scrites observed in tree hole\n",
    "aquatic habitats, in which Scrites and Cyphon were the\n",
    "most speciose genera with about 50 species overall\n",
    "described from scritidae family from India (Ruta 2007).\n",
    "Tipulids (Diptera) act as large scale shredders and\n",
    "decomposers of leaf litter in tree hole aquatic habitats.\n",
    "The primitive structural characteristic and need to keep\n",
    "the respiratory plastron constantly in contact with air\n",
    "make them stay nearer the upper level of the water\n",
    "column in the tree hole aquatic habitat preferably in\n",
    "water-air interfaces. This designates them as one of\n",
    "the first processors and decomposers of fresh fallen\n",
    "leaf litter. Two groups of Tipulidae were observed\n",
    "from tree holes in the study area, one group with large\n",
    "structural characteristic larvae belongs to the subfamily\n",
    "Tipulinae and another relatively small size larval group\n",
    "which was unidentified. It was observed that physical\n",
    "characteristics such as depth, water volume of tree\n",
    "holes, and GBH of host tree were highly variable within\n",
    "sites and between sites. The predator aquatic insect\n",
    "taxa recorded to three taxa namely Toxyrinchites sp.\n",
    "(Culcidae), Agabus sp. (Dytiscidae), and an anisopteran\n",
    "nymph of Odonata. Of these Anisoptera act as the top\n",
    "predator in the tree hole aquatic habitat (Kitching &\n",
    "Orr 1996). The remaining taxa were saprophages\n",
    "grouped into macrosparophages, microsparphages\n",
    "and filter feeders based on feeding relation on coarse\n",
    "particulate organic matter, fine particulate organic\n",
    "matter and dissolved organic matter, respectively.\n",
    "Community composition was more similar within the\n",
    "tree hole aquatic habitats of SVNP and highly variable\n",
    "between SVNP and NARF (Table 3). Interestingly,\n",
    "aquatic insect taxa such as Trichoptera, Syraphidae and\n",
    "Ceratopoginidae were completely absent from NARF\n",
    "and the coleopteran group Ptilodactylidae was absent\n",
    "from SVNP tree holes. The feeding relationship of\n",
