    "#### WRF-CHEM for Coimabtore: An option with AWS and starcluster\n",
    "\n",
    "- Considering the huge time requirement for running wrf chem over Coimbatore with high resolution (It roughly took 8 hour 15 minutes X 7 for domain 4 alone, 6 second time steps with average 50 seconds), Amazon Web Service (AWS) ```t2.medium``` instace and StarCluster compute cluster would be a viable option to make wrf-chem run in 'real time'.\n",

    "#### upgrading aws free tier into ubunut 14.01\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since access to aws free tier is through SSH, doing, up-gradation of current Ubuntu release into 14.04 by ```sudo do-release-upgrade``` warns about likely failure in ssh during process. It provide fall over by running ssh in port 1022 and asks to open port from firewall by ```iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT```\n",

    "- To remove sudo permission problem followed [this](http://askubuntu.com/questions/7477/how-can-i-add-a-new-user-as-sudoer-using-the-command-line) and command ```sudo adduser <username> sudo```\n",
    "-  Compiling WRF in a separate EBS of aws gives advantages of attaching it with EC2 cluster when ever necessary. The star cluster program behind the EC2 cluster can be dictated to do so, providing necessary re-usability of the compiled WRF CHEM program in temporary cluster environment. For a trail, 8 GB magnetic EBS was created and attached to the running free tier instance. AWS noted about potential renaming of the EBS as follows ```Note: Newer Linux kernels may rename your devices to /dev/xvdf through /dev/xvdp internally, even when the device name entered here (and shown in the details) is /dev/sdf through /dev/sdp.```\n",
