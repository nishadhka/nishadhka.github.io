    "1. It is installed to convert WRF output in netCDF to grib2 formate, which is need for grib2json tool.\n",
    "1. IRIS is dependent of large number of python scientific libraries.\n",
    "1. Most of the libraries are python and it can be isntalled though \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install libarry\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. based on the failure report\n",
    "1. It's installation further gets erroneous due to unavailability of netcdf, HDF5, netcdf-python packages.\n",
    "1. Has to follow this note (http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/wiki/UbuntuInstall) \n",
    "1. Has to install other dependencies such as udunits through synaptic package manager \n",
    "1. From its note, copied here as such\n",

    "Installing the required dependencies\n",
    "There are only two dependencies to install, HDF5 (>=1.8.2) and netCDF4. The version of HDF5 shipped with Karmic is 1.6.6, so you'll need to compile from source. Lucid will ship with 1.8.3 so that won't be necessary, but until then, read on.\n",
