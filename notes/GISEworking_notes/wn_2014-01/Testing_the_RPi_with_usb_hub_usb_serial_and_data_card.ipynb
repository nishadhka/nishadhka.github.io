    "1. with one set of RPi, UH,US,DC there is problem of ssh and ping if it is connected with proper set up, that is RPI, UH and LAN. \n",
    "1. with huge number of iteration starting from suspecting starrting with UH adaptor, then UH itslef, then RPi and then wire connecting with UH and RPI, found the problem with wire connecting UH and RPi. \n",
    "1. With this set then started the connection of DC, it was not recognized by lsusb, then connected the US, US was recognized but no DC, then DC was removed and connected to the USB point nearer to light now lsusb showed the DC and recognized, but after a while LAN connection was disrupted and no pinging also. So for this case the problem zeroed to RPi and RPi was changed to new one.\n",
    "1. Witht this new RPi all set up was working fine, that is RPi, UH, DC and US. Made a /etc/udev/rules.d/90-phone.rules with this lines\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "KERNEL==\"ttyUSB*\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"1436\", NAME=\"phone\", MODE=\"0666\",SYMLINK+=\"phone\"\n",
    "KERNEL==\"ttyUSB*\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"067b\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"2303\", NAME=\"dylos\", MODE=\"0666\",SYMLINK+=\"dylos\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. now the `/dev/phone` and `/dev/dylos` was getting created with subsequent reboot. One exception was found if the set up RPi, UH, DC and US was removed from power and restarted the `/dev/phone` was not created, it is found to be problem with usb mode switch, since the lsusb shows the DC as `Bus 001 Device 009: ID 12d1:1446 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ```\n",
    "1. This problem gets solved by removing DC and reconnecting to the UH, now /dev/phone is being created with a reboot\n",
    "1. serious problem with connecting wire of UH and RPi, it makes UH to stop working if connected to UH. now exchanged the US wire with this one now working, US also working have to check with dylos. Have to check RTC also.\n",
    "1. Now the status is, if RPi is completely get switched off (power off) the data card will be detetcted as \n",
