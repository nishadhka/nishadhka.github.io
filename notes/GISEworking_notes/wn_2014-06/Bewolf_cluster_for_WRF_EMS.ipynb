    "1. The four domain running of WRF EMS with reoslution startng from 27km, 9km, 3km to 1km gives error of ```exit with status of -9```,            \n",
    "   [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18529452/sudden-exit-with-status-of-9) showing that it would because of outof memeory status([more from this])(http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=407), this gives motivation further for cluster running of wrf ems\n",
    "2. passwordless SSH is not suffecieidnt for cluster running of WRF EMS, as specfied in run_ncpus.conf, the created cluster has to be checked with\n",
    "   netcheck script given with WRF-EMS, it is in strc folder [hint](http://strc.comet.ucar.edu/library/lists/wrfems/2011-January/000808.html)\n",
    "2. So while running netcheck with passwordless ssh, it gives error that ```ssh localhostname hostname``` is not doing pasword less ssh, in the      begning, this error seems to be ridiculus, how and what! ssh is needed for local computer!\n",
    "3. After a while repeated error on this genre, it is decided to go with normal cluster creation and try with the netcheck script again.\n",
    "4. In the meantime it is found that host name lookup is varying based on server and Desktop, ```nwlookup -A``` shows no repaly in Dekstop Ubuntu    and in server it returns hostname with its satus \n",
    "5. So googling further reveals that this discripancy might be due to hsot name decripancy or static ip difference.\n",
    "6. to resolve the doubt of static ip difference, as follwoing ubuntu server edited the file ```sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces``` and added the ip address given in [this](http://www.howtoforge.com/linux-basics-set-a-static-ip-on-ubuntu), but ater doing this after a reboot the LAN is not showing in the network manager, then found that the utilities networkmanager and network interfaces are contradaataory complementaroies [ref](http://askubuntu.com/questions/7079/how-do-you-configure-desktop-for-a-static-ip-address)[ref2](http://askubuntu.com/questions/168670/connection-not-visible-or-not-available-after-switch-dsl-to-lan) so revert back to intitial. the relaity was static ip address was earlier setup useing network manager, so this problem doubt is leftout\n",
    "7. For Host name decripancy, followed [this](http://sysblogd.wordpress.com/2008/05/16/ubuntu-changing-hostname-from-command-line/) and from this    switched to make simple bewolf cluster from ubuntu so followed [this](http://rashmi2592.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/building-a-beowulf-cluster-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts/) it satrts from host name editing of the file ```sudo edit /etc/hosts``` in hoopoe(master) and dhcppc3(node1). this tutorial was then replaced with more advanced and comphrehenive [tut](http://byobu.info/article/Building_a_simple_Beowulf_cluster_with_Ubuntu/). the steps invoves as follows, as heading given in [tut](http://byobu.info/article/Building_a_simple_Beowulf_cluster_with_Ubuntu/)\n",

It can be done by ```sudo adduser username --uid uidofmaster```, then installing nfs common ```sudo apt-get install nfs-common``` tells user is not in sudoers group, for this logout to a user name having sudo access and can be done the isntallation. But latter to mount the nfs folder sudo has to supplay, to solve this [follow](http://tuxthink.blogspot.in/2012/05/user-is-not-in-sudoers-file-this.html) ```sudo nano /etc/sudoers\\ //add this line/ username ALL = (ALL) ALL ```\n",

It seems the nfs folder mount and disruption of nfs folder can serieously hand ubuntu server, it has to solved by first stoping the nfs-kernel-server by ```sudo service nfs-kernel-server stop``` in master node, then umount the foldeer by going into root in node1 by ```sudo bash\\ umount -f -l /home/hoopoe/```, based on [this](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/15024/umount-device-is-busy-why)\n",

    "- by this step a further netcheckup was made and the ssh error goes away!, now the write permission erro due to the different UID between master and node1 username\n",
