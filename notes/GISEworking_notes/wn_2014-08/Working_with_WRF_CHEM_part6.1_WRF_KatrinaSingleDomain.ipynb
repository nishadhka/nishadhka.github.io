    "## Trail for WRF-CHEM, working with WRF simulation with Katrina single domain case\n",
    "1. It is based on [this](http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/CASES/SingleDomain/index.html) to run compiled wrf in serial mode to execute the Katrina case with single domain.\n",
    "2. As per this [page](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/CASES/SingleDomain/ungrib.htm), the WPS ungrib stage was carried out\n",

    "### WPS: Ungrib\n",
    "3. The tar file provided with the tutorial was unzipped and compiled WPS folder was copied and bothe these folders were kept under a folder named katrina.\n",
    "4. The vtable was linked inside WPS folder by ```ln -sf ungrib/Variable_Tables/Vtable.GFS Vtable```.\n",
    "5. The avn/GFS files inside the tar folder is linked with WPS folder by ```./link_grib.csh /home/swl-sacon-dst/wrf/WRF341/katrina/GFS_data/```, follwoing file with links were created by this step\n",
