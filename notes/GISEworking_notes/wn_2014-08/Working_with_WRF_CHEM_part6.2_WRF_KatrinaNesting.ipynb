So a search was made to collect the namelist for this tutorial case, but there is no direct namelist.input was available with the tutorial. So made a search directly with error what was given and found a forum [mail](http://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/wrf-users/2014/003440.html) with direct relevance of the namelist.input for same test case. Based on this and answer provided, the namelist was edited and it found, it is working. the learning found in the iteration was namelist is not mind of formates as of python but the content is important deemed to be difficult to rectified with the provided error list. The main problem found with the provided namelist is of first few lines mentioning run days in timecontrol section of namelist in which it was single value but the name list used is giving value for each domain.
