    "- tried with grib2json for converting netcdf into json [1](https://github.com/cambecc/grib2json)\n",
    "- for this netcdf has to converted into grib2\n",
    "- for converting into grib2, python based iris is useful [2](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/installing.html), but only work with cf compliant netcdf\n",
    "- WRF output in netcdf is not a cf compliant\n",
    "- So has to use a tool which convert WRF netcdf into CF compliant\n",
    "- Wrfncxnj.py tool [3](http://www.meteo.unican.es/wiki/cordexwrf/SoftwareTools/WrfncXnj) exactly do this with more functions such as extraction of variables etc\n",
