    "\n",
    "1. Based on [this](http://roadtolarissa.com/meteor-map/) and its source [code](https://github.com/1wheel/meteors/blob/master/metors.json).\n",
    "1. The meteor web application is based on one index.html file and marker visualizer based on  JS drawMap.js. \n",
    "1. The index.html was edited for to remove the CHART in the line 14 to 19 contains \n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"year-chart\" class=\"chart display\">\n",
    "\t\t\t<div class=\"title\">Year of Impact</div>\n",
    "\t\t</div>\n",

    "1. Also removed line from 129 tp 159 related with cahrts\n",
    "1. To make python to print \\ baclklash charterer\n",
    "1. based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/301068/python-backslash-quoting-in-string-literals)\n",
    "1. Then it is learn that instead of json, meteros web app is taking csv file and getting data from it even the lat and long. These functionalities are included in the drawMap.js and the line ```queue()``` where it referring the csv file is taking care of this data parsing and drawing all the realted process, such as point making in d3 (by lat long parsing) and gving other infor in pop up box.\n",
    "1. To make the cbe map visualize in d3 canvas, several attempt related with different map, shape file was made. \n",
    "1. First attempt was made with recently created ```cbe_webmap.shp``` with all the wards and village was converted into topojson by following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON cbe_city.json cbe_webmap_city.shp\n",
    "topojson -o cbe_citytopo.json cbe_city.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. But this was visulaized in canvas as hapzard rectangualr and scribbled image, for surprise. \n",
    "1. So it is doubted the problem with shape file or conversion process. to check this the ```letsmake map``` tutorial referred shape file was converted into toposjon with following command \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON world.json ne_10m_admin_0_map_subunits.shp\n",
    "topojson -o worldT.json world.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This was repolace in the meteros web app topojson and drawmap.js is edited to taking care this change, this was perfectly visulized in the canvas. This indicating the problem is related with shape file. \n",
    "1. To ascertain this again a new shape file was created with ne_10m_admin_0_map_subunits.shp opened in qgis. This file named as test_webmapA1.shp was converted into topjson with command \n",
    "```\n",
    "ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON testA1.json test_webmapA1.shp\n",
    "topojson -o testtopoA1.json testA1.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. this file was again referen in web app and editing the js file, this also viewed correctly  in the canvas. Thus indicating that the problem is with shape file.\n",
    "1. So for this, problem might be of wrong projection. Opened the world file and the cbe_webmap.shp and created a new file tracing it. This was ```testtopoA3.json``` made into viewed in the canvas of web app but having problem of zooming.\n",
    "1. Though changing the values in .scale of var proj and .scaleExtent of var zoom, the zoom is working for single time and then gets strucked.\n",
    "1. For solving above problem a new shape file as of past test ```test_webmapA2.shp``` wass created and converted into json by \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON testwebA2.json test_webmapA2.shp\n",
    "topojson -o testtopoA2.json testwebA2.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This can be viewed in canvas with zoom and drag functionality. But zoom is still strucking to a maximun limit. This made to know about the functionality of zoom comment in the D3 from [this](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Zoom-Behavior). It is found that the command ```.scaleExtent([height*.33, 4 * height])``` is indicating minmum and maximum zooming functioalty. So changing that make more control of map viewing and thus solved the porblem of cbe map view in d3 canvas.\n",
    "1. This is bascially a simple arthmeatic. To get maximum zoom value, it has to be above the ```.scale(180000)```, so if height is 500, the scale extent has to be 180000/500*height or above\n",
    "1. With this solution the digitizing cbe map ```testtopoA3.json``` was viewed in the web app and it perfectly gets viewed. Proving onceagain, one day of reading documentation is better than one week of googling. \n",
    "1. So the cbe_map overlay with world.shp file was traced with keeping the snapping option to both the shape files. Not giving this 100 pixels units for snapping option eiher of it didn't made snapping option true with turn on enabling topological editing and Enable snapping on intersection.\n",
    "1. This file was converted into topojson by following command \n",
    "```\n",
    "ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON cbe_webmap.json cbe_webmap_D3A1.shp\n",
    "topojson -o cbe_webmapT.json cbe_webmap.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This was correctly visualized in d3 canvas by giving ```.scale(150000)```,  ```.center(76.9715,11.0142)```, ```.rotate([0,0]);``` and ```.scaleExtent([height*360, 560 * height])```.\n",
    "1. Further to this the data source, fell.csv file was edited to consider the aerocet data. Before hand the aerocet data was made shorten by removing the unnecessary column by following commands.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import os\n",
    "ad=[]\n",
    "for file in os.listdir('/home/swl-sacon-dst/Documents/GISE_2013/LAB/Aerocet_DATA/Oct_sample/'):\n",
    "    if file.endswith(\"M.csv\"):\n",
    "        ad.append(file)\n",
    "for file in os.listdir('/home/swl-sacon-dst/Documents/GISE_2013/LAB/Aerocet_DATA/Oct_sample/'):\n",
    "    if file.endswith(\"M_N.csv\"):\n",
    "        ad.append(file)\n",
    "for i in ad:\n",
    "\tdb=pd.read_csv(i)\n",
    "\tdb1=db[['Time','long','lat','PM2.5(ug/m3)','PM10(ug/m3)']]\n",
    "\tdb1.to_csv('web_'+i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. There was need of minor change in the function ready(),\n",
    "```.attr(\"r\", \tfunction(d){return metorScale(d.mass);})```\n",
    "1. where it takes up the mass_g column of fell.csv for scaling the point marker size. This makes the point data of aeorcet sample completely to be visualized.  \n",
    "1. Adding the functionality of drop down to choose date\n",
    "1. This functionality is requiered to visualize the mulitple date Aerocet readings saved in different csv file. For this made a first attempt `webmap_A1` based on [this](http://fiddle.jshell.net/7KJC7/2/) and second attempt `was`webmap_A2` made with [this](http://fiddle.jshell.net/7KJC7/2/) sample code.\n",
    "1. The attempted functionality was based on drop down select to change the csv file quired in queue function (the lines 51-55 of drawMap.js) are as follows\n",
    "```python\n",
    "queue()\n",
    "\t.defer(d3.json, \"worldTopo.json\")\n",
    "\t.defer(d3.csv, csv)\n",
    "\t.defer(d3.json, \"pics.json\")\n",
    "\t.await(ready);\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Getting the csv variable value in attempt ```webmap_A1``` by \n",
    "```python\n",
    "var csv = function() {\n",
    "    var selectedValue = d3.event.target.value;\n",
    "console.log(selectedValue)}\n",
    "d3.select(\"#select-list\").on(\"change\", csv);\n",
    ".defer(d3.csv, selectedValue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. this attempt was ended with error of no csv file. So made  second attempt ```webmap_A2``` by \n",
    "```python\n",
    "d3.select('#select-list')\n",
    "  .on('change', function() {\n",
    "    var csv = eval(d3.select(this).property('value'));\n",
    "    console.log(csv)\n",
    "});  \n",
    "```\n",
    "1. this attempt was ended with getting of file name with out csv extension based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24193593/d3-how-to-change-dataset-based-on-drop-down-box-selection), such as ```web_08102014M.csv```\n",
    "1. Then it is found that changing csv file is way around method for drop down requirement. There is native d3 method for this requirement named as object constancy. Examples are [this](http://bl.ocks.org/nsonnad/4175202), [this1](https://github.com/mbostock/bost.ocks.org/blob/gh-pages/mike/constancy/index.html) and [this2](http://www.delimited.io/blog/2013/11/8/object-constancy-in-d3)\n",
    "1. Based on [this](http://bl.ocks.org/nsonnad/4175202) example the csv datafiltering by column/ time is made as follows\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rawMetors = csv;\n",
    "        var nested = d3.nest()\n",
    "\t\t.key(function(d) { return d.Time; })\n",
    "\t\t.map(rawMetors)\n",
    "        var series = menu.property(\"value\");\n",
    "        // only retrieve data from the selected series, using the nest we just created\n",
    "        data = nested[series];\n",
    "        console.log(JSON.stringify(data));\n",
    "\tmetors = [];\n",
    "\tdata.forEach(function(d){\n",
    "\t\td.mass = +d.PM25;\n",
    "\t\td.year = +d.year;\n",
    "\t\td.id = +d.cartodb_id;\n",
    "\t\tmetors.push(d);\n",
    "\t});\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. With the bove code it can filter csv file with time, which is referen cein drop down element\n",
    "1. So now to create data for the map, stacking all the csv fileinto one csv file by below code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "ad=[]\n",
    "for file in os.listdir('/home/swl-sacon-dst/Documents/GISE_2013/LAB/Aerocet_DATA/Oct_sample/'):\n",
