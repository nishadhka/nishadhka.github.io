    "1. Frame buffer is a hardware portion in memory to provide display. X window systems are the the basic display setup for computers, remember in computer every display is organized as bitmap windows. In head less Ubuntu servers virtual framebuffers are used for the application which specifically requires the display such as Firefox or other browsers.\n",
