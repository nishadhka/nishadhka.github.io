    "1. Ubunut image for parallella can be downloaded from [this](http://www.parallella.org/create-sdcard/) note, it was dd'd into 8GB SD card micro.\n",
    "1. The BOOT foilder content was not as such of [this](http://www.parallella.org/create-sdcard/) note,these files were making problem related with rebooting of the parallella. For this there is a foruym [post](http://forums.parallella.org/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=1622) states that need of device tree.dtb has to be changed and there is a file was attached with that. Using that file the problem of no rebooting of parallella was solved\n",
    "1. To run the xtemp utility with parallella, the ssh has to be invoked with ssh -X linaro@192.168.1.100, the ip address is duynamic and it can be detrermined by \n",
    "```\n",
    "nmap -v -sP 192.168.1.0/24 |grep -v down\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. For installed xtemp and with out x window ssh, these solutions are useful, such as [this](http://forums.parallella.org/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=1057) about workarround and [this](http://forums.parallella.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=930&sid=624adef734de896b552bd51983a6b444&start=10) insyalling xtemp. \n",
    "1. There are test available with parallella-example and epipheny-test, inwhich all the epipheny trest were working without problem, list based this testing is notworkied instead each test was perfomed manually. Perfomred test are such ~/parallella-examples/para-para$ ./run.sh, and attempt for R based test but the openCL version was changed and it was not able to patch that with parallella provided file\n",
    "1. The huge tempearuter graianet was solved by positon a wall fan into the board. \n",

    "**Static IP for Parallella**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SD card ubunut image installed with Parallella is having dynamic ip, this setu is problematic sometimes in doing ssh. To make the ip address from dynaimc to static carried out follwoing steps based on [this](http://www.parallella.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1178&p=7347)\n",
    "1. The SD card is munted on a laptop and edited the network/interfaces file as followes `sudo  nano /media/rootfs/etc/network/interfaces` \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\n",

    "1. Then removed the file by ```sudo rm -r /media/rootfs/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules```\n",
    "1. Edited another file ```sudo nano /media/rootfs/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf ``` as follows\n",

    "1. By setting up static ip address, it is smooth in running the SSH and connecting with other computers in the network like for pinging etc. \n",
    "1. But it won't connect with the Internet, ping www.google.com ends in no host to connect message.\n",
    "1. This problem is trival and facing similar issue with every computer I am enaged, in SERVER, Raspi etc.\n",
    "1. So made a search and found basics of defining the parameters in interfaces as per [this](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2012870) page and again edited the interfaces file as below\n",

    "1. In the above parameters the gateway is crucial for Internet, gateway is the address to open the router used. So gateway is wrong the connection will be lost and so no Internet. A quick test is to ping the gateway address, if it is not pinging one error related to this can be zeroed down. \n",
