    "1. This is for converting the mysql backed sms gateway data into sos import formate. COCEMS_lbm are sending the data every 15 minutes through SMS and it is received by server side data card and gammu SMS gateway backed by mysql, the data is in inbox table. Following python script do the job, long time was consumed in understanding the array, list objects in python, clear understanding would n't cost much time consumption.  After long frustration this I found in to takle the problem of addressing the numpy array out of mysql fetch. following,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7061824/whats-the-most-efficient-way-to-covert-mysql-output-into-a-numpy-array-in-python and based on http://zetcode.com/db/mysqlpython/\n",
