    "1. apt-get update and upgrade make BBB's internal hard disk to crash, to solve this is to make a recovery SD card and rewrite the hard disk\n",
    "1. After long searching for making the SD card finally followed this  http://www.armhf.com/index.php/getting-started-with-ubuntu-img-file/\n",
    "1. Installed the xz in ubuntu lap `apt-get install xz-utils`\n",
    "1. then viewed the attached sd card device name by `ls /dev/sd*`\n",
    "1. given it as sdb so run the xz, followed this http://downloads.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beaglebone/\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xz -dkc Angstrom-Cloud9-IDE-GNOME-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-beaglebone-2013.09.05.img.xz > /dev/sdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. after some time exit the xz then inserted the sd card and booted the beagle on from sd card now following this http://hipstercircuits.com/unbrick-beaglebone-black-without-erasing-emmc/\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh root@192.168.7.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. gives a problem of denial so followed this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19494619/how-to-interact-with-two-beaglebone-black-connected-to-one-computer made a file `.ssh/config`\n",
    "1. with this content\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Host 192.168.7.* UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null StrictHostKeyChecking no\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. now ssh is working and followed again this http://hipstercircuits.com/unbrick-beaglebone-black-without-erasing-emmc/\n",
    "1. to mount the internal hard disk with SD card running BBB\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir /mnt/microSD mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/microSD\n",
    "cp -r /mnt/microSD/lib/modules/3.8.13-00611-gd1fc8a7-dirty/ /media/Angstrom/lib/modules/\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. shutdown now but in vein, so now plan is to copy all the files in / and copy it in mms that is inside angstrom folder and reboot it without the sd card, that also didn't turned up to correct the problem.\n",
