The used inp file is [this](prep_chem_sources.inp_CBE_4domain). After editing inp file Prep_Chem_Src.exe was run by ```./Prep_Chem_Src.exe``` command in its bin folder. It run successfully as specified in the tutorial and it created seven files with three bin files for each grid as per the [tutorial](http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/wrf_tutorial_nepal/exercise_2.html). Earlier attempt failed by an un recognized error message and it was then resolved by editing a mistake in the inp file with two dots in variables such as ```POLELAT```.\n",
