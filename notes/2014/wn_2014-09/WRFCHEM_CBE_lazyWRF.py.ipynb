    "### Use script to execute WRF CHEM CBE\n",
    "\n",
    "- To run in real time and in cluster environment(AWS or ARM), various steps of WRF have to be made into script.\n",
    "-  There are several python based scripts avaiable for running WRF. The script lazyWRF is a neat and simple script to run wrf from WPS stage. \n",
    "-  The script has minor problem in running, it was forked from its git hub [repository](https://github.com/nishadhka/WEM/blob/master/lazyWRF/lazyWRF/lazyWRF.py) and edited. Adding a git repo inside a repo and mainiting its authrosihp is little diffcult, [see here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2140985/how-to-set-up-a-git-project-to-use-an-external-repo-submodule) so It was not included in the saconswl real time project repository. A clone of this git forked in github session was made and editing was carried out there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Edits on the script\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The script was giving error due to line number 208 as `` cp: missing destination file operand after``` it was solved by giving correct formate for copy operation in the line such as ```os.system('cp ' + pathtoWPS + 'namelist.wps' ' namelist.wps.python_backup')```, with this the error was reoslved.\n",
    "-  The script def function ```edit_namelist``` through wrong editing of namelist with one more domain addition, it was solved by changing the functions variable from ```def edit_namelist(old,new,incolumn=1):``` to ```def edit_namelist(old,new,incolumn=0):```. \n",
    "-  Another issue was with line numbers 238 and 239, in which lines \t\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "edit_namelist(\"dx\",str(dx*1000),incolumn=0)\n",
    "edit_namelist(\"dy\",str(dy*1000),incolumn=0```\n",
    "```\n",
    "giving 1000 repeated multiplication value. It is feature of python notes [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12733184/multiplication-in-python) while multiplying with sting and integer. This was solved by changing the value to integer and then multiplying as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "edit_namelist(\"dx\",str(1000*int(dx))+',',incolumn=0)\n",
    "edit_namelist(\"dy\",str(1000*int(dy))+',',incolumn=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Above correction through error as ```TypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'tuple'``` when running it in script. Latter it was solved by removing the comma in initial variable supplied for dx and dy. \n",
    "-  With this edit the program ```python lazyWRF.py -v``` was executed and it ran successfully upto met grid. Interestingly the program runs all file downloading different WPS program running routines in fraction of time otherwise do it manually could cost 15 minutes. Metgrid was failed with error saying that ``` At line 98 of file gridinfo_module.f90 (unit = 10, file = 'namelist.wps')\n",
    "Fortran runtime error: Cannot match namelist object name file```. A quick comparison with current namelist.wps and last successful run namelist.wps, it is found that the namelist entry ```fg_name``` was wrongly written by the script, it was corrected by editing line number 76 of lazyWRF.py to ```int_prefix = \"'FILE'\"```. After this edit metgrid run without any error. \n",
    "-  To test the both functionality of WPS and WRF simulation by lazyWRF.py, domain was kept into 1 and used the last successful running of the WRF. The script lazyWRF was edited in following lines \n",
    "    1.1 line 76, from ```int_prefix = \"FILE\"``` to ```int_prefix = \"'FILE'\"```, to avoid this error ``` At line 98 of file gridinfo_module.f90 (unit = 10, file = 'namelist.wps')\n",
    "    Fortran runtime error: Cannot match namelist object name file```\n",
    "    1.2 line 104, def edit_namelist_input was mainted as of WPS namelist edit function, other wise the namelist.input edited mistakenly.\n",
    "    1.3 line 208 was edited to consider the better file copying convention\n",
    "    1.4 line 238 and 239 are edited to correct multiplication of values avoid repetition as of python convention while multiply with integer and string\n",
    "    1.5 line 265 was added to give the current directory necessary for wrf executables\n",
    "    1.6 line 267 was edited as of 1.3\n",
    "    1.7 line 310 for remove comma after max_dom single variable entry\n",
    "    1.8 line 325 and 331 was edited to run the script in normal Linux environment\n",
    "-  After above edits lazyWRF is working upto execution of wrf.exe and running t for two hours after that it hangs and error was not reported. It is diagnosed as might be a subprocess stdout problem, exceeding buffer limit above the python convention. So a new method other than subprocess or tweak of subprocess is required. \n",
    "-  The script is required to have following improvements for WRF CHEM execution in real time\n",
    "\t1. real time GFS data download for each time frame of execution\n",
    "    1. clean WPS folder for subsequent execution\n",
    "\t1. create a archive folder as of pydown, a functionality of move wrf/wps products and namelist, creation of metadata\n",
    "\t1. prep_chem_src and or convert_emiss.exe run based on   its required namelist\n",
    "\t1. add functionality for running ndown.exe \n",
    "\t1. solve the problem of wrf.exe run and add functionality for time left for simulation completion by parsing its log file, add functionality to move wrfoutput into a safe place\n",
    "\t1. get wrfoutput for variables such as U,V,Temp, Humidity, PM10 and PM2.5 using [this](https://github.com/muellermichel/pyWRF-NMM) script or modified  \n",
