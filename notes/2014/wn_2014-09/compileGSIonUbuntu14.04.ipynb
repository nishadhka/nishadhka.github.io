    "\n",
    "- GSI was tried to compile in Ubuntu 12.04, but ended with failure. GSI requieres Gfortran 4.7 and above, ubunut 12.04 repostory is updated upto 4.6, so ubunut has to upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 to have gfortran 4.7.\n",
    "- Due to this Server was upghraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 and compiled WRFV4.3.1 and WPS 4.3.1 in it. It was by Gfortran 4.8.2, Netcdf 4.1.3, and other necssary libraries such as libpng, zlib and jasper as per apt-get method.\n",
    "- GSI is requiered to have OpenMPI for its parallell programming. For this the installation of OpenMPI was follwoed from [this](http://www.sysads.co.uk/2014/05/install-open-mpi-1-8-ubuntu-14-04-13-10/).\n",
    "- OpenMpi was installed by following commands from from above refered page\n",

    "```\n",
    "- After above point, ```./configre``` was executed and configure.gsi was edited to change its line number 43 to consider the difference in gfortaan and its commanding problem mentioned [here](http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=6086&p=22377#p22377)\n",
    "- AFter this made ```./compile > &log.compileA1``` and it ends in this error ```*** Error in `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/f951': corrupted double-linked list: 0x0000000002b5e5e0 ***```. Before getting this error, faced minimal error related with mpif90 command missing etc, easily resolved those issues, need of expert direction for above error.\n",
    "- Based on this error it is decided to use the exact same compiler and gfortran version mentioned in the user guide. For this the gfortran version 4.7 is installed by ```sudo apt-get install gfortran4.7``` and gcc version 4.4.5 was tried to install by typing ```sudo apt-get install gcc-4.4``` but it installed version 4.4.7 instead. A number of attempts such as commands ```sudo apt-get install \tgcc-4.4=4.4.5-15ubuntu1``` ends but in failure. \n",
    "- So based on the available compilers version, gcc-4.4.7 and g++-4.4.7, gfortran-4.7, the wrf will be compiled and tested for its suitablity for GSI.\n",

To set up gcc and g++, used follwoing commands\n",

    "- With this setup also, compilation ends with same error as noted above, so it is concluded that the gfortran, gcc, and g++ has to be have same version, that if it is 4.4, all has to be same. So install gfortran4.4 by ```sudo apt-get install gfortran-4.4```, this version was added into ```update-alternatives``` by \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gfortran gfortran /usr/bin/gfortran-4.4 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "- With the above change also faced same ```Fatal Error: Wrong module version``` error, from [this](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/23957) it is found that the error is due to OPENMPI compiled with wrong gfortran. Basically the gfortran when doing OPENMPI compilation based on [this](http://www.sysads.co.uk/2014/05/install-open-mpi-1-8-ubuntu-14-04-13-10/) is 4.8. So OPENMPI has to be compiled with correct gfortran needed by GSI, that is 4.7. So made ```update-alternatives``` configuration chosen to gfortran 4.7 and gcc and g++ in 4.4 then proceeded with openmpi compilation as per [this](http://www.sysads.co.uk/2014/05/install-open-mpi-1-8-ubuntu-14-04-13-10/).\n",
    "- Them again tried with netcdf compilation, But got same error as of former. For a check, tried gcc and gfortran was made into 4.8 and compiled netcdf(NOte here openmpi is made by gfortran4.7), it make check passed without any error. Then again changed the gcc to 4.4 and gfortran to 4.7, this time netcdf make check passed without any error, strange!. Made exporting of compiled netcdf folder by \n",

    "- So went into testing of netcdf *NETCDF testing* from [here](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compile_tutorial/tar_files/Fortran_C_NETCDF_MPI_tests.tar) downloaded the testing files and used, \n",
