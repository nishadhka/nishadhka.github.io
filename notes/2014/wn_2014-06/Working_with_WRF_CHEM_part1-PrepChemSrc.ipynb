    "- after unzipping, went inside the dicertoty and done the stpe as told in the README, \n",

    "1. but this step exited with errors\n",
    "- then found out that the pgf90 is a commercial compiler and so used the gfortran available in the ubuntu 12.04 machine so the comamnd becomes\n",

    "- after running it shows something something and went to next step ```make```, it gives and run for sioometimes with some words and then next step\n",
    "- in doing ```make chekc``` it gives three errors, and it was negletced and went for next step\n",
    "- in this instead of doing ```make install```, made a change of routing, make isntall delivbratley add new files where were it do so and for removing\n",
    "  it is impossible taks to read and remove the file, more details [here](http://superuser.com/questions/264601/removing-installations-done-by-make-install)\n",
    "- so followed and executed this ```checkinstall``` but asks to uisnatll checkinstall ```sudo apt-get isntall checkimnstall```\n",
    "- aftyer sthis follwoed ```sudo checkinstall``` and it asks some questions aenetered all and findlly ti gives godd news of \n",

    " Done. The new package has been installed and saved to\n",

    " You can remove it from your system anytime using: \n",
    "      dpkg -r hdf5\n",
    "```\n",
    "- so now trying the comment ``` dpkg-query --show hdf5``` giives ```hdf5\t1.8.8-1```\n",

    "### insall zlib 1.2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "- followed as per the README but with gfortran and checkinstall\n",

    "FC=gfortran CC=gcc ./configure --prefix=/path-zlib-1.2.5\n",
    "make\n",

    "- retunred as quickly the good news of isntallation success\n",
    "\n",
    "### intsall netcdf4.1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "- downloaded netcdf4.1.1 and went and run as per the README but with gfortran and checkinstall but returned wrror saying ```undefined open_mpi_char```\n",
    "- so installing openmpi1.6.5, openmpi currently is 1.5 and retired it seems, so trying with source compilation as per [this](http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2012/07/19813.php)\n",
    "- the code followed is\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "FC=gfortran CC=gcc CXX=gc++ ./configure --enable-fortran\n",
    "```\n",
    "- but gives error of ```configure: error: C and C++ compilers are not link compatible.  Can not continue.```\n",
    "- so run the ```./configure``` with pretext, let it take waht ever availble in computer! and it completet with out any error\n",
    "-  next made netcdf install with \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "FC=gfortran CC=gcc CXX=gc++ ./configure --prefix=/path-netcdf-4.1.1\n",
    "make\n",
    "``` but exited with same error of ```undefined reference to `ompi_mpi_char'```\n",
    "- googling shows this [page](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/mailing_lists/archives/netcdfgroup/2010/msg00455.html) saying HDF5 has to be installed with ```--enable parallell```\n",
    "- so removing HDF5 earlier made, ```sudo dpkg -r hdf5```\n",
    "- redoing it with \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "FC=gfortran CC=gcc CXX=gc++ ./configure  --prefix=/path_libs/hdf5-1.8.8 --enable-parallel --with-zlib=/path_libs/zlib-1.2.5  --disable-shared --enable-fortran\n",
    "make\n",
    "```\n",
    "- but netcdf still giving the same error of ```undefined reference to `ompi_mpi_char'```\n",
    "- so doing configure without any options, it also giving the same error\n",
    "- so with the available netcdf(I am figuring out how this netcdf was installed) in the computer, used the location of netcdf and run prep-chem-src, but it giving huge chunk of error starting with non availability of hdf.\n",
    "- In this way as told in README, it gets installed in ```/path_libs```\n",
    "- some useful comments, to view the location of installed packages ```dpkg -L netcdf```, to view the compilers in the computer ```dpkg --list | grep compiler```, to view environemtn realted with netcdf ```printenv  | grep NETCDF ```\n",
    "- A fresh try was made after a cipule of days, in which googleing was made with compilation error given, one such error is ``` undefined reference to `__netcdf_MOD_nf90_open'```, this search fetched to view the nc-config to know about the lib forlder and include folder of installed compiled netcdf, it seems, for installing IRIS python package, netcdf 4.3.2 was isnatlled and it was located in /usr/local ptth, the command ```nc-config --all``` gives all like this info. \n",
    "- so the file in prpe_chem_src folder bin/build ```include.mk.opt.gfortran``` is edited to change this new info, but compilation failed with similar error. more search on this regard saying that one needs to include a new netcdff with double f has to be include, this clue is given in [this](http://www.yambo-code.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=755) , [this](https://www.myroms.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=1414) and [this](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1033570.html), more over directly solving this problem for prep chem src, there is an arabic language web page showing that the file ```include.mk.opt.gfortran``` has to be edited and the line asking for netcdf library has to be ```NETCDF_LIBS=-L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff``` instead of ```NETCDF_LIBS=-L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf```. later it is found the the tutorial for nepal WRF-CHEM aslo saying this to be changed, hrrr. \"half a hour wrf manual reading is better than one week google search\" \n",
    "- with this changes the prep_chem_src is get compiled with good news of but with warnings of ```/usr/bin/ld: warning: libhdf5.so.6, needed by /usr/lib/libnetcdf.so.6, may conflict with libhdf5.so.8```.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Finished building === ../prep_chem_sources_RADM_WRF_FIM.exe\n",
