    "#### Aerocet Sampling Data, using kml files and pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data from dust pollution monitoring in Coimbatore using Aerocet was copy paste into a csv file from miniterm.py program and command ```2``` given to aerocet. Seprate CSV files were made for count and mass mode sampling. \n",
    "-  The location of sampling point is made into a point feature in Google earth with name of respective sampling time. This was saved as kml file and opened in QGIS converted into shape file to add gemoetry. The shape file was subject to edit by attribute calculator and added new two columns of lat and lon by x and y gemorty for respective columns, these columns were formated as STRINGS to get all decimal values of lattitue and longitude. The shape files is then converted into csv files using MMQGS plugin. Giving decimal or real number rounds the lat long values and become non usefull while converting into CSV file. \n",
    "-  The csv files two of aerocet data with time and location data (lat lon) with time have to merge into single file for storing and further analysis. \n",
    "-  An initial attempt was made with [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20414562/python-joining-csv-files-where-key-is-first-column-value) to merge the csv files as dcits, but having limitations in terms of sorting, join/merge and other sql function needed for analysis. Then found familar pandas libarary is most useful in this case. \n",
    "-  To join location file with nay of the data file, the time has to smilar fomrate. In location file only time is given, in data file it is date and time. A huge number of search and attempts were made to do text into column for data file time column having data and time seprated by sapce. Based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18034361/how-to-split-a-dataframe-column-into-multiple-columns), [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14745022/pandas-dataframe-how-do-i-split-a-column-into-two) and most handy by [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116814/pandas-how-do-i-split-text-in-a-column-into-multiple-columns), but having problem in the commands \n",

It becomed difccult in join again these data frame with mother data frame. Faced problem such as ```AssertionError: length of join_axes must not be equal to 1``` for doing merge those data frame by merge as ```df1 = pd.merge(df, s, on='Time', suffixes=['Time','Status']), and for doing concat by ```df1 = pd.concat([df,s],join_axes='Time')``` getting ```ValueError: too many values to unpack``` \n",
    "-  Then made attempt of reciprocal method that is add date to the place csf file data frame and join with other data file. For this to add date to the time data frame, used this ```df['Name']='2014-10-08 ' + df['Name'].astype(str)```, here Name was the column heading given for the time as it is given in kml file. this column heading was changed by ```df=df.rename(columns={'Name':'Time'})```\n",
    "-  With this also mergeing ends with error of ```AssertionError: length of join_axes must not be equal to 1``` from command ``` df2=pd.concat([df,df1],join_axes='Time')```. Then it is found that the error is due to lack of index in two merging data frame. Index for data farme was made by ```df.set_index('Time'); df1.set_index('Time')```,  then merging of the datframe ends without any any error by the command ```df2 = pd.merge(df, df1, on='Time', suffixes=['_1', '_2'])```. Withis all the three dataframe can be merged one by one, in which suffixes gives tag to differentiate the two datframe same columns heading. \n",
