    "## Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "The seasonality is an important characteristic of natural systems. We investigated the seasonality in water chemistry of four urban lakes of Coimbatore undergoing different gradient of urbanization impact. The result shows that the seasonal variability of water chemistry was more apparent and significant in less polluted lakes than more polluted lakes. Ukkadam lake and Kurchi lake the most polluted lakes under investigation does not show significant variation in seasonal water chemistry. The results indicate the collapse of seasonality in lakes system by suppressing buffering capacity of water body, nutrient circulation between non living, living components, and cumulative effect of pollutant accumulation in polluted lake. The result also provides the opportunity to evaluate the state of lakes groups undergoing different gradient of impact by recognizing its well being and devising better management options to conserve the remaining wilderness centers in urban landscape.    \n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Rivers, wetlands, lakes are in close association with human existence for centuries as basic source of potable water. Lake have natural or anthropogenic origin people constructed lakes in downstream of rivers as a source of portable water, food resources, irrigation, recreation and waste disposal (Beeton 2002). During ancient days, lakes were constructed mainly for storing potable water and for irrigation purposes. This essential functionality makes societies to safeguard the well being of lakes ecosystem. But in long time this crucial need was circumvented by urbanization, availability of alternative water sources results into negligence and detoriation of lake quality. Thus, lakes once used for water resources are rapidly changing ironically into waste water storage tanks and waste dumping sites. \n",
    "Urban lakes acts as an important source of ground water recharge it detoriation will negatively influence the quality of ground water (Refer). It is observed that urbanization has long lasting impact on the lake ecosystems along with total retardation of the system (Booth and Jackson 1997). This dynamic and complex problem makes conservation and mitigation efforts ineffective in their goal with narrow knowledge on functionality of lakes as a system. This can be overcome by regular monitoring and assessment of the lakes well being.\n",
    "Coimbatore, the second largest city in Tamil Nadu, undergoing rapid industrialization and rise in population pose considerable strain on basic amenities of the city. The city faces serious scarcity of water, is drought prone and has maximum number of bore wells in the country. The river Noyyal, formerly a perennial one, flows through the city. Currently, there are 28 lakes present in and around the city largely fed by river Noyyal, and act as storage and percolation tanks. Canals feeding the lakes prodigally acted as natural drainage courses and served as storm water drains for the city. However, currently many of these channels are dysfunctional for encroachments and unauthorized constructions. The river, a monsoonal one, during lean months goes dry thus, serving as a dumping yard for garbage and industrial wastes. Moreover, many of these wetlands are also in part being used as garbage dumping yard, and in the danger of complete filling in due course. The present study was undertaken to assess seasonal variation of physico chemical characteristics of lake water to get insight about fluctuation of pollution status and degradation in these lakes.  \n",
    "## Materials and Methods\n",
    "To assess seasonal variation of water chemistry of lakes in Coimbatore, four lakes viz. Perur lake (L1),  Kuruchi lake (L2), Ukkadam lake (L3) and Chinnakulam lake (L4) ) located within a geographical extent of 23 sq.km were selected for water quality monitoring (See Chandra et al 2009 for detailed description of lakes).\n",
    "(The lakes existing in and around this area are facing varying degree of degradation from urbanization, sewage and industrial effluent discharge, garbage dumping, and agricultural activities. Though these lakes pollution status were addressed during the earlier studies [6 rachna], whose seasonal variation in water chemistry was not known were included in the present study. Surface water samples were collected from three sites at each lake during summer (May 2008), and five sites during monsoon (August 2008), post-monsoon (November 2008), and winter (February 2009). Aliquots of surface water samples were grabbed from each lake and transferred in pre-treated / laboratory cleaned bottles, labeled, and to ice boxes with frozen gel packs. The samples were then transferred to the laboratory, stored at 4°C in dark till further processing and analysis. Physico-chemical parameters namely pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC, µS/cm), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS, mg/l), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD, mg/l), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD, mg/l), alkalinity (mg/l), chlorides (mg/l), phosphates (mg/l), sulphate (mg/l), ammonia nitrogen (mg/l), and nitrate nitrogen (mg/l) were examined following standard methods (APHA 1992, Saxena 1987).\n",
    "## Data Analysis:\n",
    "We used multivariate analysis of PCA ordination technique to visualize the seasonal variation of water chemistry in each lake.  The first principle component of PCA (PC1) ordination reflects the seasonal variation in each lake. The data on water variables was log-normalized and used for Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and the results were represented in biplot ordination diagram. The vectors in biplot ordination diagram represents water chemistry variable and length of each vectors reflects its importance in ordination. One way ANOVA was carried out using required principle components which can effectively summarize the data (Rencher 2002) to quantitatively assess the apparent variation observed in each lake during four seasons. We used non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test  to assess the results of one way anova.\n",
    "## Results and Discussion:\n",
    "For all the water chemical variable analysed for  It is observed that all the parameters values are highest in Ukkadam lake followed by Kurchi lake, Chinnakulam lake and Perur lake. It shows that Ukkadam lake is the most polluted amongst the studied lakes. In the case of seasonal variation, form PCA biplot ordination diagrams (figure-01-05)and one way ANOVA carried out in first two principle components of Chinnakulam lake shows the highest significant variation (F3,20=8.07,P<0.001). This was followed by Perur lake (F3,32=3.04,P<0.0419)and Kurchi lake (F3,44=2.6,P<0.064)in which first three principle components and first four principle components respectively are used for variance analysis to sufficient the threshold percent explanation and eigen value average. (refer).  Least variation was observed in Ukkadam lake (F3,32=0.82,P<0.4779) in which first three principle components are used for ANOVA. This was again confirmed by Kruskal-Wallis test shown in (Table -02)\n",
