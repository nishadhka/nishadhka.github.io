    "total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the lakes\n",
    "were found to be different from those reported\n",
    "almost a decade back. The concentrations of phos-\n",

    "that though the biochemical oxygen demand and\n",
    "chemical oxygen demand values were lower for\n",
    "the Ukkadam wetland, the values for Perur wet-\n",

    "Wetland natural resources, common receivers of\n",
    "wastewater and urban runoff, are under immense\n",
    "pressure due to pollution, dumping of waste and\n",
    "urbanisation. Rivers, wetlands, lakes and other\n",
    "water bodies have made crucial and enormous\n",
    "contributions to human development, which iron-\n",
    "ically has become a major cause of their degra-\n",
    "dation and decimation (Prusty 2008). Lakes and\n",
    "wetlands, appreciated for their water resources,\n",
    "ground water recharges and habitats of a wide va-\n",
    "riety of fauna and flora, are facing varying degrees\n",
    "of pressures and consequent fall in the ecological\n",
    "goods and services they offer. Such degradation\n",
    "is caused by the urban, industrial and agricultural\n",
    "effluent discharges and hydrogeomorphic changes\n",
    "of canals and rivers linking these lakes. Inflows\n",
    "of wastewater-carrying loads of nutrient in due\n",
    "course of time overwhelm natural assimilation and\n",
    "carrying capacity of the receiving water bodies\n",
    "(Prusty 2008). Several pollutants, ranging from\n",
    "oxygen-demanding organic pollutants, nutrients\n",
    "and heavy metals to siltation, play a major role\n",
    "in the degradation of wetlands. These pollutants\n",
    "subsequently directly affect their autoregulating\n",
    "capacity, buffering capacity and biotic inhabi-\n",
    "tants. Sediment-dwelling organisms, their envi-\n",
    "ronment being the final deposition of pollutants,\n",
    "are overmuch subject to these pressures (Gupta\n",
    "and Sharma 2005).\n",
    "Wetlands situated in the vicinity of cities un-\n",
    "dergo rapid degradation due to various factors\n",
    "related with city development: waste dumping,\n",
    "deforestation, industries and large-scale reclama-\n",
    "tion for other uses. Coimbatore, one of the fastest\n",
    "growing cities in Tamil Nadu, India, suffers from\n",
    "the pace of change in the cityscape and growing\n",
    "population. There are around 28 wetlands in and\n",
    "around the city limits which are largely fed by\n",
    "the river Noyyal, flowing alongside the city. These\n",
    "wetlands serve as storage and percolation tanks\n",
    "and are major recharge sites for groundwater.\n",
    "Regardless of the ecological services offered by\n",
    "these wetlands, many of them face destruction\n",
    "due to infilling and encroachment. The prevailing\n",
    "drainage and sewers in the city are open types,\n",

    "during May 2008 to carryout our work (Fig. 1).\n",
    "Sampling stations included three locations each at\n",
    "the Ukkadam wetland (L1), Perur wetland (L2),\n",
    "Kuruchi wetland (L3) and Chinnakulam wetland\n",

    "examined earlier by Mohanraj et al. (2000).\n",
    "The Ukkadam wetland (L1), having the largest\n",
    "water spread area among the Coimbatore wetlands, is situated close to a municipal market and\n",
    "bus stand. This wetland is the ultimate receiver\n",
    "of various industrial effluents, urban sewage and\n",
    "municipal solid wastes. Although, in the past,\n",
    "large quantities of solid waste were dumped along\n",
    "its banks, recently, a change has happened and\n",
    "the quantity of solid wastes dumped has reduced\n",

    "Seasonally, the wetland is covered\n",
    "with dense Eichhornia crassipes and other hydrophytes. The Ukkadam wetland, situated close\n",
    "to the bus stand, is known to attract several\n",
    "migratory birds. Perur wetland (L2), spreading\n",
    "264.8 acres, attracts 77 avian species (Palaniappan\n",
    "2008). Encroachment in this wetland is nearly\n",
    "1.5 acres and comprises 100 huts in the foreshore\n",
    "and 50 on the bunds. The wetland is surrounded\n",
    "by agricultural lands, villages and roads. One third\n",
    "of the wetland is colonised by Acacia sp., facilitating nesting by colonial birds such as egrets. The\n",
    "third study site, the Kuruchi wetland (L3), has a\n",
    "water spread area of 343.96 acres and holds the\n",
    "least water storage capacity because of its shallow-\n",
    "ness. In the tank, 9.50 acres is encroached by about\n",
    "200 huts on the bund and 274 abutting the chan-\n",
    "nels. This wetland receives municipal sewage and\n",
    "is a site for dumping garbage from inhabitations\n",

    "1,000 mg/l in L1 and were double the value re-\n",
    "ported by Mohanraj et al. (2000). The high TDS\n",
    "in Ukkadam wetland (L1) may be attributed to\n",
    "effluents from industrial units such as dyeing in-\n",
    "dustries joining the wetland. Senthilnathan and\n",
    "Azeez (1999) have documented the textile dyeing\n",
    "and bleaching industries releasing large quanti-\n",

    "wetlands act as sinks for nutrient deposition and,\n",
    "hence, the high TDS values may also depend on\n",
    "the age of the lake (Anitha et al. 2005) as a\n",
    "result of gradual salt deposition, an observation\n",
    "not always applicable for monsoonal wetlands.\n",
    "Dissolved oxygen (DO) did not vary much and\n",
    "was in the range of 4.21–5.56 mg/l. The lowest\n",
    "DO was recorded in Kuruchi wetland (L3). This\n",
    "lake is surrounded by many household/domestic\n",
    "waste dumps. The sewage from the vicinity flows\n",
    "down, and would have lead to low DO content.\n",
    "Oke (1999) reported that aquatic plants impede\n",
    "water movement and vertical circulation of DO,\n",
    "leading to lower DO content of the wetland/lake,\n",
    "especially at lower layers. The low DO content in\n",
    "Kuruchi wetland (L3) is attributed to the dense\n",
    "growth of E. crassipes in the wetland. BOD, which\n",
    "expresses the biodegradable organic matter dis-\n",
    "solved in water, varied from 2.1 to 4.96 mg/l. BOD\n",
    "was highest in the waters of Kuruchi wetland (L3).\n",
    "BOD within the range 1–5 mg/l demonstrates\n",
    "moderate water quality. The COD varied from 60\n",
    "to 430 mg/l and was highest in Ukkadam wetland\n",
    "(L1). This could be associated with higher levels\n",
    "of inorganic wastes being discharged into the wet-\n",
    "land. The present values of BOD and COD in\n",
    "Ukkadam (L1) were lower than those reported\n",
    "by Mohanraj et al. (2000), perhaps as a result of\n",
    "the recent control on dumping solid wastes on\n",

    "sible limits prescribed by WHO (1997). The BOD\n",
    "values in the present study were lesser than the\n",
    "values reported by Sunkad and Patil (2004). An\n",
    "inverse correlation of DO with water temperature\n",
    "(Bath and Kaur 1997) is well known, perhaps for\n",
    "the low availability of DO.\n",
    "The nutrients, i.e., phosphate and sulphate,\n",
    "were in the ranges of 0.12 to 1.60 mg/l and 9.26 to\n",
    "102.86 mg/l, respectively. The high phosphate and\n",
    "sulphate values were recorded from Chinnakulam\n",
    "wetland (L3) and Ukkadam wetland (L1), respec-\n",
    "tively. Phosphate concentration in clean water\n",
    "ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/l. Our result shows high\n",
    "concentrations of phosphates in all the wetlands\n",
    "sampled. Nutrient loadings are primarily from the\n",

    "**Conclusion and management suggestions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four lakes studied mainly serve irrigation\n",

    "wetlands is of serious concern and poses consid-\n",
    "erable impact on aquatic biota, public health and\n",
    "ground water quality. The river Noyyal during\n",
    "rainy season gets flooded, while during lean, drier\n",
    "months, it carries enormous amounts of sewage\n",
    "and other wastes. This affects the water quality of\n",
    "the adjacent wetlands. As hinted above, the dete-\n",
    "rioration of the lakes was mostly due to discharge\n",
    "of effluent from industries like dyeing, jewelry\n",
    "making, foundries, urban sewage and municipal\n",
    "solid waste dumping. The lake boundaries are\n",
    "also used for dumping household garbage. These\n",
    "wetlands provide the city with valuable ecosys-\n",
    "tem services and goods, and their conservation is\n",
    "very essential for the cityscape and the population\n",
    "in the area. High nutrient input due to several\n",
    "reasons has led to the increased growth of water\n",
