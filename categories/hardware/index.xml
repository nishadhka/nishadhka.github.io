      <description>####Parallellaupand_run#### 1. Ubunut image for parallella can be downloaded from this note, it was dd&amp;rsquo;d into 8GB SD card micro. 1. The BOOT foilder content was not as such of this note,these files were making problem related with rebooting of the parallella. For this there is a foruym post states that need of device tree.dtb has to be changed and there is a file was attached with that. Using that file the problem of no rebooting of parallella was solved 1.</description>

      <description>###Redeploy Dylos in TDM###
 After running with problem of excessive particle reading in UPS back up power, this note discuss its redeployment in same station. The problem of UPS back up power excessive reading was contained by using pure sine wave UPS. In redeployment as an addition, DHT11, humidity temperature sensor was added along with DYLOS, RPi, USB data card setup. The DHT 11 humidity temperature sensor was attached with RPI following this as per the below .</description>

      <description>####cubie truck cluster for WRF CHEM####
This note explains the steps in creating cubietruck cluster for WRF CHEM modeling.
#####Installing debian##### 1. cubietruck is preinstalled with Android as its main os for its inbuilt nand storage of 8 GB harddisk. To chane this into debian os follwoing steps were followed. 1. More number of attempts was made for running debain or ubunut os image in cubietruck, Later found a tweaked image from here aat first sight shows promising for WRF CHEM.</description>

RPi(Raspberry pi) has problem in serial read of dylos air quality monitor data, the serial read ends with wrong or misplaced data from the dylos monitor, this problem was mentioned in this (note)(Serialportproblemlbm1knmr.md). For example runnnnig of the python command for getting dylos serial read ends as follows
 pi@raspberrypi ~/SMS $ python &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import serial &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ser = serial.Serial(&#39;/dev/dylos&#39;, 9600, timeout=60) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; line = ser.</description>

 Aerocet 531S(A531S) has serial communication and commanding interface through USB connection. By connecting USB to Linux ubunut 12.04, running the program serial port terminal and giving the command such as S starts the A531S. These commands are elaborated in its user manual. There number of other commands to view the data and get more about the A531S operation as per its user manual. To make the process of running the machine and entering the command in Python to start the machine or read output is the aim of this note.</description>

WRF-CHEM is a computationally intensive model, for example &amp;ldquo;On a typically-sized 40×40 grid with 20 horizontal layers, the meteorological part of the simulation (the WRF weather model itself) is only 160 × 106 floating point operations per time step, about 2.5% the cost of the full WRF-Chem with both chemical kinetics and aerosol&amp;rdquo;[1].It is generally executed with parallel mode to reduce time latency of model execution time.</description>

 After a long searching for making the SD card finally followed this http://www.armhf.com/index.php/getting-started-with-ubuntu-img-file/ Installed the xz in ubuntu laptop apt-get install xz-utils then viewed the attached sd card device name by ls /dev/sd* given it as sdb so run the xz, followed this http://downloads.</description>

      <description>There is a problem of ssh and pinging if connected with proper setup, that is RPI and LAN. 1. with some iteration starting from suspecting starting with UH(USB hub) adaptor, then UH itself, then RPi and then wire connecting with UH and RPI, found the problem with the wire connecting UH and RPi. 1. With this set then started the connection of DC(Dylos Cable), it was not recognized by lsusb, then connected the US (USB Serial pin), US was recognized but no DC, then DC was removed and connected to the USB point nearer to light now lsusb showed the DC and recognized, however, after a while LAN connection was disrupted and no pinging also.</description>

      <description>The static IP address addition on SD card seems not connecting RPi (Raspberry Pi) to the Internet (1) 1. A possible way is to remove DHCP and invoke static 2. So the command netstat -nr will show up only the
Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 Window irtt Iface 0 0 eth0
without UG flag (from http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/7146/static-local-ip-gateway-config-on-startup-issues)
so no gateway, no way to access the Internet</description>

      <description>For building a mobile particulate matter pollution monitoring. Fusing a Arduino controlling Shenyi dust sensor and am Android tablet.
Alternatives: 1. Tried with Amarino library and apps 2. App Inventor and Arduino with blue tooth shield 3. Crude code and android app
following links were most useful for error-free slave connection between Android and Arduino with seed studio blue tooth shield.
