      <description>###Ubunut 12.04 recovery###
 Changing/ editing the file /etc/environment has a huge problem after a reboot in Ubuntu. Added the environment variables for ncl language in /etc/environment as export NCARG_ROOT=/usr/local/ncl-6.2.1; export PATH=$NCARG_ROOT/bin:$PATH. Which resultant in the problematic reboot of the system. The system gets instead of into login page, gets flickering command log. By reboot went inside of command line and there no system command like ls or sudo was not working and indicating no /bin folder in PATH environment.</description>

      <description>Having this problem of Ubuntu server stuck at grub menu and not going inside automatically, enter has to pressed to get inside and also into a blank, useless screen with single hyphen with no activity to view or enter a command. The workaround was by pressing ENTER after few minutes of server reboot, solved!. This problem was with Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS in IBM, started after sudo apt-get upgrade . One of the option to resolve grub struck problem is to edit the grub2 options in file /etc/default/grub, but in the server there is no such file.</description>

      <description>The frame buffer is a hardware portion in memory to provide a display. X window systems are the basic display setup for computers. The display in the computer is organized as bitmap windows. In headless Ubuntu servers, virtual framebuffers are used for the application which requires display explicitly such as for Firefox or other browsers. Xvfb provides a virtual display for those applications. In Ubuntu headless server (server without any GUI) this is installed for mainly running Selenium scripts which require a browser to run.</description>
